Generative AI is an tool that people can choose to use. Although there might be situations where it would struggle, people can simply decide not to use AI, so if AI would be harmful in that situation, we can just simply not use it there and only use it for use cases that it is good at. To prove that AI is harmful, the con side must prove that their argument stands even if the user decides not to use AI to help with that particular use case.
