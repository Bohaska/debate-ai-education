# Summary
## **Tracking impact Post-training**

The long-term impact of Kabakoo’s training programs is evident. Our recent post-training assessments highlight several key areas of growth :

1. Treatment group learners consolidated their learning habits after training. **They achieved an average score of 2.1 at six months and 1.9 at 18 months post-training, compared with 1.5 for the control group**. This shows that Kabakoo learners maintain a long-term learning mindset.
2. Six months after training, 42% of learners received orders or obtained jobs related to their training, 65% of which were paid. At 18 months, this figure was at 46%, with 42% of opportunities being paid. These results illustrate the direct impact of training on the creation of professional opportunities.
3. Learners in the treatment group saw a significant increase in their income. Eighteen months after training, they reached an average category of around 120,000 FCFA, compared with around 70,000 FCFA for the control group - **an increase of 71%**. This demonstrates a considerable positive economic impact.
4. After 18 months, the NPS stood at 83, indicating that learners would strongly recommend the training to others for its impact.

Among the learners of our 2020 batches, the incidence of a _growth mindset increases by 105%_ and _learners’ self-confidence increases by 47%_. Moreover, 90% of our learners consider that their personal and professional situation has improved as a result of the Kabakoo program.

Our highdigenous model allows us to train youths from different educational backgrounds without diploma prerequisites. _22% of our learners didn’t finish high-school. Already 30% of our learners are women_, a significant share for tech-oriented education.
