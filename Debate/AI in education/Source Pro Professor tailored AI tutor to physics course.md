# Summary

Think of a typical college physics course: brisk notetaking, homework struggles, studying for tough exams. Now imagine access to a tutor who answers questions at any hour, never tires, and never judges. Might you learn more? Maybe even twice as much?

That’s the unexpected takeaway from a Harvard [study](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4243877/v1) examining learning outcomes for students in a large, popular [physics](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/) course who worked with a custom-designed artificial intelligence chatbot last fall. When compared with a more typical “active learning” classroom setting in which students learn as a group from a human instructor, the AI-supported version proved to be surprisingly more effective.

> Our findings provide clarity; here we show that students learn more than twice as much in less time with an AI tutor compared to an active learning classroom, while also being more engaged and motivated.

> Students in the AI group exhibited a higher median (M) post score (M = 4.5, N = 142) compared to those in the active lecture group (M = 3.5, N = 174). The learning gains for students, relative to the pre-test baseline (M = 2.75, N = 316), in the AI-tutored group were over double[](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4243877/v1#Fn5) those for students in the active lecture group.

4.5 - 2.75 = 1.75
3.5 - 2.75 = 0.75
1.75/0.75 = 233%

> Students rated their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 representing “strongly disagree” and 5 representing “strongly agree.”

> With the first statement, “I felt engaged (while interacting with the AI tutor) / (while in lecture),” the students in the AI group agreed more strongly (Mean = 4.1, SD = 0.98) than those in the active lecture (Mean = 3.6, SD = 0.92), t(311) = -4.5, _p_ < 0.0001. 
> 
> Likewise, with the second statement, “I felt motivated when working on a difficult question,” students in the AI group agreed more strongly (Mean = 3.4, SD = 1.0) than those in the active lecture (Mean = 3.1, SD = 0.86), t(311) = -3.4, _p_ < 0.001. 
> 
> Students’ average level of agreement with the remaining two statements (“I enjoyed the class session today” and “I feel confident that, with enough effort, I could learn difficult physics concepts”) were not statistically significantly different between the two groups.

> 70% of students in the AI group spent less than 60 minutes on task, while 30% spent more than 60 minutes on task. The median time on task for students in the AI group was 49 minutes.
