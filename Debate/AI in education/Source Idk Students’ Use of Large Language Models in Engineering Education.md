# Abstract
- Exploration of LLMs, like ChatGPT, in engineering education and assessment of students' acceptance, perceptions, efficacy, and detection chances.
- Engineering students produce high-quality essays with LLM assistance, maintaining academic performance.
- LLM assistance benefits the students' understanding of the topics.
- Thirteen LLM detectors tested achieved unsatisfactory results, and limitations.
- LLMs availability emphasizes the importance of developing students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

None of the tested detectors could be deemed reliable in identifying text generated by AI, thus it is advisable for teachers not to depend solely on a detector for identifying text generated using LLM.
