Framework: 

Generative AI is an tool that people can choose to use. Although there might be situations where it would struggle, people can simply decide not to use AI, so we just use AIs if it works and don't use it if it doesn't work. A spoon is not very useful for a lot of things, but it doesn't mean that it's bad, because it's good at one thing, eating, and we use it for that. To prove that AI is harmful, the con side must prove that there are harms even if the user decides not to use AI to help with things it is bad at and only use it for things that it is good at. 

Contention 1: AI helps learning 

Many studies have found that student learning have improved after the introduction of AI.  

[Nie et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09975) found that people in an online coding class who were given an AI tutor to learn from had a 6.8 percentage point increase in their exam course. 

[Henkel et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09809) gave an AI-powered tutor on WhatsApp to students in Ghana, which worked with basic mobile devices on low-bandwidth data networks, improving scores of students who used it by 8.5% relative to control, with learning gains more than double of the control group. The service only costs $5 per student per year, a lot cheaper than tutors. 

[Vanzo, Chowdhury and Sachan 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15981) found that a tutor bot helped improve grades by 4.3 percentage points for students in the equivalent of 11th grade, with an effect size double of that of a good teacher (see Henkel et al. 2024 for good teacher reference). 100% of returning high-school students who used the homework tutor bot wanted to use it next year. 

[Kabakoo 2024](https://www.kabakoo.africa/impact) found that an educational program with AI virtual mentors achieved a learning score of 1.9 18 months after completing the program, compared to 1.5 for the control group, showing a 27% increase. 

[Möller et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14642) found that an AI-powered exam studying feature increased progress scores of users by 46 percentage-points 

[A study](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2024/09/professor-tailored-ai-tutor-to-physics-course-engagement-doubled/) of an AI tutoring bot for a Harvard physics course found that students given the AI tutor performed over double as well on their exams compared to control, with a 133% gain. 

Contention 2: Teachers use ChatGPT to help them make better lessons.  

[A survey from the Walton Family Foundation](https://www.waltonfamilyfoundation.org/chatgpt-used-by-teachers-more-than-students-new-survey-from-walton-family-foundation-finds) found that 51% of teachers used ChatGPT. And 73% of teachers believe it can help students learn more. This disproportionally benefited, Black and Latino teachers, with 69% of these teachers using gen AI. 

[A survey by McGraw Hill](https://www.mheducation.com/news-insights/press-releases/2024-global-education-insights-report.html) found that more than double of educators across all six continents believe AI has had a mostly positive impact on educational outcomes, compared to those who believe that it's negative. 

[A report from the World Economic Forum](https://www.weforum.org/publications/shaping-the-future-of-learning-the-role-of-ai-in-education-4-0) found that 40% of all work time could potentially be saved by large language models, with half of that coming from reduced spent time on administrative tasks.  

[A study by Morgan Stanley](https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/generative-ai-education-outlook) found that by cutting down on administrative work and maximizing human interaction, generative AI could bring $200 billion in value to the global education sector by 2025. 

[Copur-Gencturk et al. 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131523002403) found that an 11 hour AI program helped teachers improve their teaching ability, increasing student scores by 4 percentage points relative to control, even after adjusting for confounders.  

[Research by Merlyn](https://www.merlyn.org/blog/3rd-party-research-confirms-that-merlyn-reduces-teacher-stress-and-saves-time) found that an AI-powered teaching tool cut technostress in teachers by 14% in seven weeks. 51% of teachers reported an increase in teaching time savings and efficiency, and 3 percentage points less time on managing technology, 6 percentage points less time on administrative tasks, allowing teachers to spend 16 percentage points of more time on teaching.  

[Wang et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03017) made an AI bot to help improve the teaching ability of tutors. Students working with tutors that have access to their Tutor CoPilot were 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p<0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p.  

There are even free programs for teachers. For example, anyone who signs up for Khan Academy as a teacher gets completely free AI resources for them to help manage their workload, such as Khanmigo, with over 20 different AI tools to help teachers out.  

Contention 3: AI increases accessibility 

Good teachers are scarce, especially in less resourced countries. Having a private tutor is a high cost that many people cannot afford. However, AIs are widely available to people from all places in the world as long as they have an internet connection, helping to lower barriers to education and allow more students to access education, especially in underserved regions. 

Offering generative AI increases exam participation. According to [Nie et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09975), offering GPT access to students who are from low development countries had 14 percentage points more in exam participation rates compared to control. 

Offering generative AI increases grades. According to [Henkel et al. 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09809), giving students from Ghana access to an LLM to study math increased their scores more than the effect of a good teacher. The LLM tutor had an effect equivalent to moving the students up one grade level. Most importantly, this LLM tutor only costed $5 a year.  

Offering generative AI increases income. According to [Kabakoo](https://www.kabakoo.africa/impact), a platform teaching digital skills to people in Africa with AI-powered tutoring, they found that incomes increased 71% after the lessons and learners’ self-confidence increased by 47%. 22% of participating learners were those who didn’t finish high-school in the past, and they managed to benefit from Kabakoo's AI tutoring software.
