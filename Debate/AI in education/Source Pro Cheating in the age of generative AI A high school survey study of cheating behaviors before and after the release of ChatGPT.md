# Abstract
The public release of ChatGPT and other generative AI chatbot technologies has been accompanied by questions about how academic integrity and student cheating behaviors will be impacted. We analyzed anonymous survey data from three high schools to see if self-reported cheating numbers changed following the introduction of ChatGPT and similar technologies. This survey data set is unique in that data on cheating had been collected with this set of schools both before and after November 2022, when ChatGPT was publicly released and drew attention to these educational concerns. The results suggested that **cheating behaviors remained relatively stable after the introduction of this current generation of generative AI chatbot technology**. However, some changes in reported behaviors differed depending on the type of cheating (social cheating, AI-related cheating, etc.). Additional survey questions about high school students’ AI chatbot usage and the perceived allowability of such technology revealed mixed opinions on the acceptability of using AI for various academic-related tasks. Most students did not think that using a chatbot to produce an entire paper or complete an entire assignment should be allowable. However, there was support for using AI chatbots to help students to start on assignments and papers and to help explain new concepts to them.

## 6. Results

### 6.1. Responses on cheating scale

Across schools for the years analyzed, between 59.9% and 69.5% reported engaging in at least one academically dishonest behavior in the previous month. These numbers were relatively consistent for Private High (2019: 61.3%, 2022: 62.4%, 2023: 59.9%). The range was higher for Charter High (2019: 82.7%, 2022: 64.0%, 2023: 64.4%) and Public High (2019: 69.5%, 2023: 62.7%). [Conner, Galloway, and Pope (2009)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#bib6) would be the first year in which responses could be provided after the rollout of ChatGPT and other similarly powerful AI chatbots, it is worth noting that **the overall percentages from responses stayed about the same or decreased overall relative to prior years** (i.e., Public High 2022; 2023; Charter High 2019; 2023). Responses to cheating items are provided for the three schools in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl3), [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl4), [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl5)

#### 6.1.1. Cheating scale items without significant difference

Across all three schools, five items on the cheating scale (C37, C39, C40, C44, C45; refer to [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl3), [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl4), [Table 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666920X24000560?via%3Dihub#tbl5)) showed no significant difference compared to 2023, indicating no major changes in reported behaviors. Pertinent to AI-generated writing, there were no significant changes for items C39 (paraphrase or copy a few sentences from a written source without attribution) and C45 (turning in work done by someone else). It may be that students do not consider AI technology a written source, the sentence level is not where paraphrasing or copying happens, or that students did not consider AI to be ‘someone else’.

With respect to potentially using an AI chatbot as an aid during an assessment, the lack of significant differences for C40 suggests there has not been a major overall proportional change driven by the introduction of AI.

#### 6.1.3. Cheating scale items connected to AI with some significant differences

As noted above, there were five items with no significant differences in any comparison with 2023. That included items C39 and C45, which could be pertinent to using AI for providing text to use in writing assignments. Two other items seemed to have relevance to AI: C41 and C42. C41 was the most direct question about artificial intelligence use. Note that the language of C41 changed in 2023 as AI was not as prominent of a concern until the end of 2022. The former language involved asking about use of a device in an unauthorized way during an assessment. The newer language explicitly named artificial intelligence and broadened to include assessments, school assignments, and homework. This newer language was used as it was unclear how students recognized chatbot technology and if its use was for them bound to mobile devices. Moreover, with heightened public concern around chatbot technology, explicitly naming various writing products beyond assessments was deemed appropriate in order to directly consider several different types of assigned writing that students may be asked to do for school. This showed a significant difference for Charter High (2019–2023: χ2 = 10.197 df = 1 p = 0.001, 2022–2023: χ2 = 29.882 df = 1 p < 0.001) and Public High (2022–2023 χ2 = 15.886 df = 1 p < 0.001), but not for Private High when a Bonferroni correction is applied (2019–2023: χ2 = 4.316 df = 1 p = 0.038, 2022–2023: (χ2 = 0.617 df = 1 p = 0.432).

## Debate block
An 2024 study conducted by a Stanford University researcher found that there were no noticeable differences in cheating caused by the release of AI when comparing surveys about cheating before and after the release of AI, and that overall cheating even slightly decreased throughout this period. There were also no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of cheating with technology before and after AI was introduced.
