# Abstract
Scholars and practitioners have called for personalized and widely accessible [professional development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/professional-development "Learn more about professional development from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (PD) for teachers. Yet, a long-standing tension between customizing support and increasing access to such support has hindered the scale-up of high-quality PD for individual teachers. This study addresses this challenge by developing a computerized program for middle school mathematics teachers that provides frequent opportunities for teachers to interact with and obtain personalized and real-time feedback from a virtual facilitator based on [natural language processing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/natural-language-processing "Learn more about natural language processing from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Based on the data collected from 1727 middle school students in an experiment in which the teachers of these students were randomly assigned to the program or the business-as-usual condition (i.e., the control group), we found that **the program had a statistically significant impact on students’ mathematics performance**. These results demonstrate the potential of incorporating an automated, interactive feedback tool supported by artificial intelligence to create effective, scalable [teacher PD](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/teacher-professional-development "Learn more about teacher PD from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

On average, students of teachers in the treatment group scored 0.56 scale score points on the posttest, whereas students of teachers in the control group scored an average of 0.52 scale score points when we adjusted for students' grade and their individual and class-average baseline test scores.

The study found that an 11 hour AI program helping teachers improve their teaching ability increased student scores by 4 percentage points relative to control, even after adjusting for confounders.
