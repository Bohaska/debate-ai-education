# Abstract
This work contributes to the scarce empirical literature on LLM-based interactive homework in real-world educational settings and offers a practical, scalable solution for improving homework in schools. Homework is an important part of education in schools across the world, but in order to maximize benefit, it needs to be accompanied with feedback and followup questions. We developed a prompting strategy that enables GPT-4 to conduct interactive homework sessions for high-school students learning English as a second language. Our strategy requires minimal efforts in content preparation, one of the key challenges of alternatives like home tutors or ITSs. We carried out a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in four high-school classes, replacing traditional homework with GPT-4 homework sessions for the treatment group. We observed significant improvements in learning outcomes, specifically a greater gain in grammar, and student engagement. In addition, students reported high levels of satisfaction with the system and wanted to continue using it after the end of the RCT.

The tutor bot helped improve grades by 4.3 percentage points for students in the equivalent of 11th grade, with an effect size of 0.6. 100% of students who used the homework tutor bot wanted to use it for their next high school year.
