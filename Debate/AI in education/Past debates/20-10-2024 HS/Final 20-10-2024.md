Resolved: "**The benefits of the use of generative artificial intelligence in education outweigh the harms.**"
# Pro: Avenues OL PY

## Shangzhen Zhu
For the 1st:
- The arguments that AI can save teachers from administrative tasks and enhance accessibility for students are strong, but the point about economic growth is a bit weak.
- Questioning how many students use GAI for homework wasn't a strong rebuttal. It would have been more effective to mention that monitoring software for GAI usage already exists and is widely implemented in schools, strengthening the counterargument.
for the 2nd：
- Expanding on how GAI can aid students in thinking more critically and deeply effectively highlighted its benefits for learning.
- Mentioning the existence of GAI monitoring software to prevent cheating was a strong rebuttal, effectively countering concerns about misuse and reinforcing the case for AI's positive impact in education.

## Linyi Yong
The pro has confirmed the universality and effectiveness of AI-assisted teaching through discussions with different groups, which can be recognized. One suggestion is to analyze the argument in more depth, such as the reliance on AI mentioned by the con, and whether AI can also improve students'  part of creativity compared to traditional methods

## Waqas Ahmed
Teachers shortage, Accessibility,  
1st: The constructive speech effectively elucidated how the benefits of AI, particularly in addressing teacher shortages and enhancing accessibility, outweigh the harms. This argument was supported by well-cited references and compelling data statistics.
Logically and skillfully defended crossfire, asking good questions.
2nd:  The speaker refuted each of the opponent's arguments with reasoning and supported their stance with relevant data.
The debate was effectively summarized, providing a precise analysis of the main points and clashes, which helped clarify the key arguments for the audience

## Faiz Rasul
Speaker 1: very high energy delivery. can overcome the teacher shortage. can reduce screen time. data is very centred towards content. adaptive learning. can excess at any time. fluency is good. jobs. 
 well centered questions in cross fire. 
 
Speaker 2: confident and vocal. positive gestures as per requirements of content. voice variations are effective. solid references supported with well managed content. personalized learning is possible. effective rebuttal. can ve more fluent in delivery. no conscious mind so biasness is only due to data provided by humans in data bases. 

# Con: Other SP
## Shangzhen Zhu
for the 1st:
- The concerns that students will cheat using GAI, that it will harm critical thinking, and that GAI may present false information which people may struggle to discern are indeed unique drawbacks of GAI.
- However, the argument did not directly address the issue of student misuse of GAI, and providing data to support this claim would have strengthened the response.
- Your delivery was clear and well-executed, which added strength to your overall argument.
for the 2nd：
- You should include some data on students' over-reliance on AI.

## Linyi Yong
The logical framework of the con is very clear, but it is more convincing to be careful to give appropriate evidence and consider different stakeholders to show the necessity of the reasons why the harms outweigh the potentials.

## Waqas Ahmed
Over dependence, Biased Data 
1st: The constructive speech laid a robust groundwork for the harms of AI, particularly focusing on issues of over-dependence and biased data. This foundation effectively highlighted the significant challenges AI poses to education and decision-making.
Crossfire require more solid and logical reasoning  
2nd: During the rebuttal, each contention was systematically addressed with logical reasoning, particularly regarding the workload of teachers.

## Faiz Rasul
Speaker 1: can reduce screen time. too much reliance of AI is damaging for critical thinking. can improve body language or gestures atleast. references are good but not solid enough. biased issues.   energy is low improve to make debate imapctfull. 
 not up to the mark in cross fire. 
 
Speaker 2: too much screen time. AI is actually is leading to more time usage and over reliance is another issue. lead to reduced student teacher interaction. no new solid contention other than speaker 1.  no body language usage at all. need improvements. 

# Final decision
## Shangzhen Zhu: Pro
PRO effectively highlighted the support GAI offers to both teachers and students, and since CON did not counter this point, it intuitively stands. The main clash in this debate centered around whether students would use GAI to replace critical thinking, complete assignments, or cheat. While CON pointed out unique drawbacks of GAI, such as cheating and false information, they failed to provide data or usage rates to substantiate these claims. PRO countered by mentioning the existence of AI detection software, which helps prevent cheating, and argued that GAI can enhance student thinking, making their position more convincing overall.
## Linyi Yong: Pro
The pretty good thing that both sides have done is that each contention is more detailed by offering impact timely. One suggestion is that we should provide empirical evidence rather than just generalization. And more engagements and comparisons are wanted.

## Waqas Ahmed: Pro
It was close debate and both teams debated very well. I voted PRO side because 
- The team skillfully navigated the clashes, effectively articulating strong arguments about the impact of biased information and misinformation, as well as the importance of workload relief for teachers. Their points were supported by strong references and logical reasoning.
The CON side also debated very well however 
- the speaker encountered difficulties in delivering effective responses to the questions posed during crossfire and struggled to adequately defend their points about critical thinking and plagiarism.
## Faiz Rasul: Pro
This is a pro ballot. The pro side is loaded with solid content and data. They manage it very well through effective team work. They negate all points raised or asked by con side. Their contentions like AI can reduce the work load of teachers by 40% and is helpful in learning skills and getting jobs are solid. The point of personalized learning and availability of tools 24/7 is also a plus point. The con side only stayed with lake of critical thinking and biased notation are not enough to negate pro side. Con side need to improve. Good luck to pro side for future as well. 

# ChatGPT summary

In this debate on whether the benefits of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) in education outweigh the harms, the **PRO** side prevailed due to more robust arguments, evidence, and rebuttals.

### PRO Case:
1. **Teacher Shortage & Workload**: PRO emphasized that GAI can alleviate teacher shortages by reducing administrative burdens, freeing up more time for teaching. They argued that GAI can handle repetitive tasks, allowing teachers to focus on more critical educational aspects.
2. **Accessibility & Personalized Learning**: PRO highlighted that GAI enhances educational accessibility, offering personalized learning to students at any time. The team stressed that this adaptive learning can meet individual needs, supporting student growth.
3. **Critical Thinking & Creativity**: The team defended against claims that GAI harms critical thinking, instead arguing that GAI can promote deeper student engagement through tailored feedback and by sparking new ideas.
4. **Cheating & Monitoring**: To counter CON’s concerns about cheating, PRO mentioned existing AI detection tools that help schools monitor for misuse, strengthening their case that GAI can be regulated effectively.

### CON Case:
1. **Over-dependence & Critical Thinking**: CON’s main contention was that students might become overly reliant on GAI, leading to a decline in critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, they lacked substantial data to support this claim.
2. **Bias & Misinformation**: CON argued that GAI can present biased or false information, posing risks to students' learning. This argument was raised effectively but failed to counter the robust benefits outlined by PRO.
3. **Screen Time & Teacher-Student Interaction**: CON also claimed that GAI would increase screen time and reduce personal interaction with teachers, but they did not provide solid data or compelling evidence to support these points.

### Judges' Decision:
- The **PRO team** provided more **comprehensive evidence** and addressed each of CON's concerns directly, while **CON's arguments** were often **underdeveloped** and lacked strong supporting data. PRO effectively rebutted concerns about cheating and critical thinking with solutions like monitoring software and examples of GAI fostering learning.
- PRO’s data-driven approach, combined with their clear explanations of how GAI can improve accessibility, teacher workload, and personalized learning, made their position more persuasive overall.
  
Ultimately, **PRO** won due to their effective use of evidence, logical reasoning, and well-reasoned rebuttals that outweighed the potential harms identified by **CON**.
