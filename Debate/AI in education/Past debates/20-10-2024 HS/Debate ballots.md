# Debate 1

## Pro
1st speaker: well explained/analyzed and clear speech. During the crossfire, please calm down and ask the questions instead of stating the evidence within it. 
2nd speaker: during the crossfire, try not to speak at the same time with the opponents, which will make the speech time meaningless. 

## Con
1st speaker: for the contention speech, try to make your speech clearer, pronounce the words accurately and analyze the impact. During the crossfire, please calm down and ask the questions instead of arguing with the opponents. Could be more engaged during the crossfire. 
2nd speaker: good rebuttal speech, which is very targeted and strongly analyzed. but during the crossfire, try not to speak at the same time with the opponents. 

## Final decision
there are several clashes in this round. 1: accessibility. pro wins over the it by proving that generative AI is more affordable than the teachers. 2. teachers can benefit from it. Pro proves why and how teachers can benefit from it. that is why pro wins this round. 

# Debate 2

## Pro
Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence. You also did a good job giving rebuttals to your opponents by giving layers of logic and factual responses. The impact analysis and weighing on the whole case is pretty well.

## Con
you have really good constructive speech with a clear structure. During the rebuttals and the crossfire part, try to lay out more layers of analysis to give responses to your opponents.Try to give more characteriztion and definition analysis of GENAI to prove why your evidence is actually valid.

## Final decision
This is a pro ballot. Two main clashes in this round.
The first clash is about functions and capabilities of GenAI. Pro points out the false understanding of GenAI on con side, arguing that the technology of GenAI makes AI smarter much more intellectual. con side failed to give clear and well supported response to this point. Comparatively, the evidence provided on con side is not the latest and misleading. 
The second clash is about cheating. Con argues that AI helps students cheating. Pro offered data that gen AI can help check cheating with accuracy of 98%, which is much more accurate and efficient than human checking. Based on this, pro is able to take this point.
By comparing the two clashes, pro is able to win on more impacts.

# Debate 3

## Pro
1. make sure to emphasis the titles for contentions and sub points will make your case more clear.
2. second speaker, let your opponent talk during cross 
3. if you wanna talk about what is gen ai in later debate better define it earlier

## Con
1. better prepare for a debate,whether is finding the right case or cutting the precise card

## Final decision
The debate will be a cost benefit analysis
1. the main clash of this debate is about whether AI can assist teachers
    (1) cheating, checking cheating is helping teachers, and there is a significant improvement with Gen AI
    (2) Teaching experience, ai cannot help manage classrooms.
    (3) time saving, there is a clear 70 % time ave for assignment grading
2. false information, it is mostly because trash in and trash out, and false news according the entire evidence
3. Foreign language learning, lack of clash

# Debate 4

## Pro
Speaker 1: The case tried to covered different groups. A bit  rude in the crossfire. The defense of false information and bias is bad. Practically just took all the impact from the con.

Speaker 2: Clear logic in crossfire. Pushed for the critical pieces of cards. The defense is good. Should have explained how AI is utilized in the pro world without the risks of being abused. 

## Con
Speaker 1: The speaker was a bit nervous, the delivery could use more clarity. Two and a half minutes spent on the first contention. Could use better time distribution between different contention. 

Speaker 2: Nice preparation. The defense on disabled students is good. Should have done more work on the accessibility issue. Should have emphasized your winning points in the final focus.

## Final decision
The pro side set the ground clear that Gen-AI is not replacing conventional educators but rather assisting them. The pro side successfully explained the link behind how Gen-AI mitigates the education gap. The crossfires are rude. The con side managed to tackle points. The pro side dragged this debate into a debate over accessibility and the con side failed to address the points they are winning with enough strengths. Overall, it's a pro ballot for more standing impacts.

# Debate 5

## Pro
1st speaker: In the constructive speech was equiped with reliable data and adundent of evidence. I love the way when the 1st speaker elaborate the the gender gap argument, it's quite innovative and convincing.
I would encourage you to slow down a bit when delivering complex points, especially when discussing the technical aspects of generative AI. This would give the judge more time to absorb the key information.
2nd speaker: rebuttal effectively addressed the key points made by your opponents, particularly their concerns about the misuse of AI in academic settings. 

## Con
1st speaker: Your delivery was engaging, and you showed confidence throughout the round, particularly when responding to tough questions in crossfire.

2nd speaker: You did a great job defending your case and began to weigh the impacts toward the end of your rebuttal

## Final decision
The Pro side focused on utilitarism like expanding access to education, improving learning outcomes for students who need personalized support, and helping teachers manage more efficiently. These are have broad-reaching, positive consequences for the future of education. 
For clashes on accessibility, By comparing the cost of hiring a teacher and AI, Pro proved  AI education offers more affordable choice for developing countries. And pro proved that AI could detect biased info & plagiarism which turned the impact of biased information and inequality for treating students. Pro did a better job by pointing out Evidence from Amazon not apply to whole market, which could not be generalized. 


# Debate 6

## Pro
1. need a framework and definition for the debate

## Con
1. need more clear title
2. do not be so struggle on numbers

## Final decision
this is cost benefit debate focusing on the education as a broad term, both on the subjects and values
1. ai tutoring learning, although low cost for ai itself, but with the fact that a lot people cannot even afford a device,  the assistance of ai become none valued. 
2. personalized teaching: although ai do can provide some form of improved teaching experience, but the case actually targeting a minority group which should not go into a broad discussion a general cost benefit analysis
3. mis-use: both side did not provide enough data

# Debate 7

## Pro
you have really good constructive speech with a clear structure. The main issue on your side is that just as the counsel argued, you're only benefiting the minority group of people, even if you are able to prove it's true. So try to include more stakeholders on your side and benefiting more.

## Con

Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence. You also did a good job giving rebuttals to your opponents by giving layers of logic and factual responses. The impact analysis and weighing on the whole case is pretty well.

## Final decision
this is a con ballot. This is a very close debate. Two sides are very comparative and the responses and defenses are very pretty good.
Two main clashes in this debate. 
The first clash is about the minority group. Pro gave layers of analysis on this point supported by heavy evidence, arguing that Gen AI is more accessible and more personalized than human teachers. Con pointed out that Gen AI has so many flaws, con proved that in many cases Gen AI provide unclear answers and inaccurate information. They further argue that even it's accessible, it only benefits the minority. This is the main reason why I vote for Con. They are able to point out that based on framework, the best case scenario on Pro is benefiting the minority group of people. 

The second clash is about misuse. Pro try to argue that the misuse issue is not directly related to the tool itself. However, Con side points out that they failed to give clear evidence that such negative impact is not the dominant trend, and Con gave clear evidence that students are inclined to cheat by using AI.

# Debate 8

## Pro
1st speaker: I appreciated how organized your speech was. You laid out your contentions clearly and followed a logical structure, making it easy to follow your arguments. 
2nd speaker: your rebuttals were strong, especially when you pointed out the weaknesses in your opponentês evidence. You did well defending your case, but I would like to see more weighing of impacts in the future.

## Con
1st speaker: your delivery was confident, and I liked how you explained the importance of each contention. However, be sure to offer more explanation of your warrants.
2nd speaker: you had some great crossfire moments, especially when you asked probing questions that forced the other team to justify their logic. One area to improve is making sure you prioritize which points to rebut. In your speech, you spent too much time on minor arguments, leaving the bigger issues underdeveloped.

## Final decision
Definition of Language model, even if Pro advocate the Chat GPT is not the only language model in the market, it's the first and the majority generative AI in the market. 
Con proved over rely on AI lead to negative cognitive development, with solid evidence of human interactions in education is irreplaceble (from APA), and turn the impact that AI could only be supplyments but not replacement. 
Greater magnitude in impact. 
ethical converns have a severe consequence, which weighing a huge impact: Con succesfully proved baised and misinformation, and the link of how students rely on generative AI harms acedemic integrity. 

# Debate 9

## Pro
Speaker 1: Considered the benefits of teachers as well. The links and analysis in the later half of the case is a little weak. Nice preparation, could do better answering the probe questions in the crossfire. Tried to find the uniqueness of problems with AI

Speaker 2: Nice try turning the over reliance point. Bad logic trying to use over-reliance as a proof of Gen-AI's reliability. Didn't do much defense in rebuttal. Bad strategy asking for the damage of bias. 

## Con
Speaker 1: The overall analysis of the contentions are thorough and clear. But I do believe that some of the explanations could be shortened to include more content. The case might seem a little weak content-wise. Kept questioning figure and stats. Could have pushed harder on the link for bias and inequalities.

Speaker 2: Pre-written rebuttal. Rude in crossfire. Some of the responses doesn't really address the points of opponents' case. Didn't prove how traditional learning in uniquely better.

## Final decision
This round is good as both sides made nice attempts trying to dodge or rebut points from the other side. The con side only fully elaborated the impact of critical thinking and biases during the final focus. The pro side overall was trying to tweak the definition and topicality issues but failed to extend their own impacts. The con side made kept on pushing on solid statistical evidence and managed to tackle down points raised by the pro. At the end of the day, this is a con ballot for more standing impacts.

# Debate 10

## Pro
the 1sr speaker: the contention speech is clear and structured. For evidence checking, you should better prepare/keep the link in advance to save the prep time. 
the 2nd speaker: try to give more targeted response to opponents’ speech. for example, don’t stop at providing 3% information are misinformation, but even if data provided by con is true. why your impact is more significant than your opponent. Good final focus speech. 

## Con
the 1st speaker: the contention is well explained but the relevance to the topic, especially in education is a little low. Try to make the arguments more relavant. 

2nd speaker: very strong personal style during the crossfire. In the rebuttal speech, try to give more targetd response/rebuttal to your opponent’s speech. for example, dont stop at “”teachers will ingnore the nuances of students”, but to say/prove why ignoring the nuances is more harmful than benefits from pro. th

## Final decision
there are several clashes in this round. 1. whether GAI can bring higher quality of education. pro argues thta more advanced/prepared PPT and other resources and quick response can help improve the teaching quality while con replies that it would ignore the nuances. however con didn’t prove why ignoring the nuances are more harmful, so pro still makes more sense for this point. 2. personalized learning, pro gives more evidence and impact. 3. con wins over the clash of overrelying AI. Overall pro wins this round. 

# Debate 11

## Pro
Jamie: You presented the constructive speech well! Please slow down a little when moving onto different arguments from one another.

Haobo: Great come backs in your rebuttal speech. I love how you are very familiar with PF rules during evidence check.

## Con
Zhenyu: You prensented your constructive speech smoothly. Please be more familiar with your side and your cases for future rounds.

Muhan: Great point to start with your rebuttal about how only checking the date of your news evidence means the evidence itself should be considered valid.

## Final decision
The CON side argued that generative AI produced 80% false narratives in a previous task. However, the PRO side countered that this study is outdated, as it was conducted over 1.5 years ago and does not reflect the current capabilities of AI. The PRO’s point that generative AI creates job opportunities for African American populations remained uncontested throughout the debate, although the CON side responded by claiming that many African populations do not speak fluent English. While this rebuttal raised an interesting point, it was largely irrelevant to the argument. Additional details were addressed during the oral comments session of the debate

# Debate 12

## Pro
Chris: I love how you are familiar with your case so well! 

Amber: I can tell how prepared you were for this debate through your quickly-formed responses in your rebuttal speech and crossfire sessions.

## Con
Fangzhe: You presented well in your constructive speech! Your speaking pace was easy to follow.

Yue: I love how structured your rebuttal speech is! Keep it up for your future rounds too. You will only get better. You asked really great questions in crossfire!

## Final decision
I am convinced by the point where CON mentioned Generative AI requires internet access, but there are many people from developing and underdeveloped countries could not even afford basic education, there is no chance for them to afford subscriptions to Gen-AI or receive educative benefits from Gen-AI. PRO’s arugment for this point did not make sense to me during the debate, I do not think this has nothing to do with unable to afford AI means they cannot afford tutors, and thus AI benefits weigh more.

# Debate 13

## Pro
Speaker 1:very pro active start. 
availability is the main advantage.  can ask question at any time point. gesture movement is effective. Cost effective. precise information and instructions. advantage for disable students. also beneficial for teachers.  references are solid. 
 very energetic in cross fire. 
 excellent summary speech. good team work. 
 
 
Speaker 2: mature delivery. good rebuttal to con side. content is solid. personalized assistance is possible. later half of rebuttal is not up to the mark. AI have more accuracy then humans. quality of questions is good in cross fire. 

## Con
Speaker 1: ethical concerns. can provide biased data. not focused content. miss or wrong information can also be there. can improve body language. delivery is smooth and vocal. 
 can add more facts and figures in content. over reliance is another concern. ability to development mental compatibility is limited now. more consequences then benefits. 
 need to listen question first. 
 
 
Speaker 2: very vocal but not focused. again just pointing the same point of speaker 1 should come up with solid rebuttal. improve gesture movement they are not as per content. Internet excess. not cost effective. the rebuttal should centered around other team points not generic. 

## Final decision
The pro side take this ballot to win the competition. Their solid content, contentions and team work make this happen for them. The points like personalized assitance, availability across the times, cost effectiveness and its ability to help teachers also to plan better for their teaching lessons are main points that drag me to this decesion. Con side have to come up with more question other than biasness and under age limitations. congratulations to pro side.  

# Debate 14

## Pro
Good to hear accessibility and stability about the usage of AI and educational opportunities could be well provided by AI. Also, it would better release the pressure on teachers by shortening their working time. Good to rebut in Pro’s framework, students’ action as misusing AI could be well solved. 

## Con
It’s good to hear education quality being affected and then have influence on critical thinking and decision making, acoompanied with students’ lack of academic perfomance and future development.

## Final decision
This is a Pro BJ DX XHHS HJ ballot. 

First of all, I would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!

Clash 1-Tangible impact-
Both sides have their own discussion on this point. Pro proves that in their case, AI could help both teachers and students because it could provide more opportunities for students and release students’ pressure. Con explained that even just tools, which would be hard for students to tell the difference. It’s dangerous to use AI in that frequent way. Good for Pro providing the comparison that balance between the usage and key stakeholders could be well maintained. It would be better if Con could give more direct comparison and engagement on how this trend could be stopped.


# Debate 15

## Pro
The constructive speech effectively elucidated how the benefits of AI, including accessibility, precise content, personalized learning, and reduced workload for teachers, outweigh the harms. This argument was supported by well-cited references and compelling data statistics.
Crossfire require more solid and logical reasoning  
2nd: During the rebuttal, the crossfire clash was handled effectively, with each contention systematically addressed using logical reasoning. This reflected a strong grasp of the topic, supported by several data facts and statistics.
The debate was effectively summarized, offering a precise analysis of the main points and clashes 

## Con
The constructive speech laid a robust groundwork for the harms of AI, particularly focusing on issues of dependency, ethical concerns, and the risks of misinformation and biased information.
Logically and skillfully defended crossfire, by raising  good questions.
The speaker effectively refuted each of the opponent's arguments with reasoning and supported their stance on the age limit for using AI with relevant data.
They defended the crossfire very well, demonstrating strong argumentation skills and effectively countering opposing points.

## Final decision
Both teams debated well. I will vote for PRO side because 
-the team exhibited adept handling of clashes, particularly in presenting compelling arguments regarding age restrictions and regulation, as well as the reliability of AI. Their points were underpinned by strong references and logical reasoning, bolstering their position and effectively countering opposing viewpoints.
The CON side also debated well however 
-the speaker encountered difficulties in delivering effective responses to the questions posed during crossfire. They also failed to adequately defend their points about dependency and accuracy, missing opportunities to provide supporting evidence or examples that could have strengthened their argument.

# Debate 16

## Pro
for the 1st:
-The argument regarding how GAI supports students' learning processes and assists teachers in their teaching is solid.
-Raising questions about how the mechanism would occur is a strong approach and effectively challenges the opposition.
 
for the 2nd
-The stance that strong regulation can better address potential issues is a valid one.
-The delivery was clear and articulate, making the argument easy to understand and impactful.

## Con
for the 1st:
-Regarding ethical issues, misinformation, and bias, while the negative impacts of misinformation were discussed, there was no strong linkage explaining why or how misinformation would occur with GAI.
-The argument about over-reliance on GAI similarly lacked a clear mechanism. The reasoning behind how this over-reliance would develop wasn't sufficiently explained. Strengthening the linkage for both points would have made the argument more compelling.
for the 2nd：
-While useful data was employed to counter the opposing argument, there was still a lack of clear linkage, such as explaining why AI would harm teachers' teaching. Providing a stronger mechanism or reasoning behind how AI could negatively impact teaching would make the argument more convincing.

## Final decision
Overall, CON's argument lacked clear linkage. While the impacts of misinformation and over-reliance on AI are strong points, the explanation of why these issues would occur was missing. The mechanisms behind how GAI could lead to these problems were not well explained, weakening the overall argument. In comparison, PRO's mechanism and impact analysis were stronger. They clearly explained how and why their points would lead to positive outcomes, providing a more convincing argument overall. The benefits of GAI for both disabled students, general students, and teachers were clearly presented.
Clash:1. Will GAI lead to over-reliance? CON did not provide a mechanism to explain how over-reliance would occur, jumping straight to the impact. However, PRO countered this by suggesting that proper regulation can prevent such issues.2.Will AI harm teachers? PRO argued that GAI would assist teachers in their teaching, while CON suggested that it could harm them, but failed to explain why or how this harm would manifest.

# Debate 17

## Pro
The pro side can seize the opponent's loopholes in time and give a strong response, but the universality and long-term benefits should be further considered.What's more, more empirical statements are appreciated.

## Con
The con focus not only on the development of individuals but also various stakeholders, and at the same time they have more evidence and data rather than a non-empirical statement when giving arguments. 

## Final decision
The whole debate needs to compare the advantages and disadvantages of using AI for teaching, not only to talk about the potentials or risks of AI-assisted teaching. Therefore, more powerful engagements and comparisons between the two sides are needed, and at the same time, more stakeholders can be paid attention to and their relationships are also worth discussed.

# Debate 18

## Pro
 I appreciated your organization and logical flow, and Con, your emphasis on ethical issues and passion for the topic stood out.you effectively highlighted the ways in which generative AI can enhance personalized learning, providing tools that help students learn at their own pace.

## Con
you did an excellent job raising ethical concerns around AIês role in education, especially in terms of biases and privacy. Your argument about the potential for generative AI to exacerbate educational inequality was well-supported with evidence. That said, I think there was room to dive deeper into how these harms could manifest on a practical level in schools. 

## Final decision
On the environmental concerns, I agree with your assessment that while climate change is a crucial issue, itês not directly relevant under todayês debate topic. You were right to shift the focus back to education-related impacts. Pro side, you made a strong argument by illustrating that inequality and poverty are not caused by AI itself, and you effectively pointed out that 60.5% of the global population now has access to the Internet. Your stance that generative AI could help solve inequality was well-argued, especially with the idea of AI offering educational tools to bridge the gap. However, the Conês point about 35% of people in developing countries still lacking internet access was a powerful rebuttal. 

# Debate 19

## Pro
Speaker 1: Great question on scalability. Too much time spent in the summary on the industrial use of AI and its fiscal potentials. 

Speaker 2: Good line by line rebuttal. Relied a little too much on non-uniqueness. Should do more extensions like how AI detects the bias. Wasted time in final focus on cheat comparison.

## Con
Speaker 1: The arguments are generic but well established. Do not weaponize evidence check. Should better explain how AI jeopardize moral education.

Speaker 2: Great try pushing ethical education is also included in the debate. The rebuttal could use more organization. Rude during crossfire. 

## Final decision
Both sides should drop the mentality of telling the judges what the opponents failed to do. Leave that for the judges to decide. Both sides should calm down and focus on how what they could do better to improve their own arguments. The pro side relied a little too much on uniqueness in their defense. The con side on the other hand, also failed to establish a clear link between how implementing AI could harm the ethical education. At the end of the day, the voting issues became which side better promotes the education efficiency with pro winning on teachers saving time from admin work and work individually on kids.

# Debate 20

## Pro
Try not to have too mant distorted card , prolly it's cool when no one is checking it, but u should at least have some defense on that at the point u choose to put that into your contention.

## Con
In terms of constructive , I think the impact can be more tangible since your opponent has pushed their impact onto academic performance and income etc. Should've come up with less abstract impact like cheating behavior/CO2 etc.

Onto responses, the card checking was really good to invalidate their evidence, this greatly mitigate your opponents impact. but your own burden of proof is remained fulfilled

Make sure you do more weighing to tell the judge which impact is more important since both team have economic impact on teachers : Increased productivity vs Job loss.



## Final decision
On Accessibility/Inequality 
Pro analyze the limitation of teachers in the status quo and how AI solve them to bring more accessible education to students with impact landing upon education with better quality.Teams clash on the card on rate of accessibility on Internet. Pro delink this by saying why there's no causation but more about poverty.We do need more mechanized analysis from con to prove how with the absence of GAI the inequality is going to be solved and thus pro win on this clash.

On Students 
Pro was able to prove with logical and empirical warrant elaborating how GAI improve 60% of academic performance.Con told us that this incentivize plagarism and cultivating dependence.But overall given that the ultimate quantifiable result was on improve academic performance on Pro though the credibility of evidence was challenge(Card reads AI driven program, which included AGI)  .

On Teachers
Pro's card on salary was proven to be invalid but the time saving card still stands. Con's impact was on job displacement. Pro mitigating with analysis on why job displacement is inevitable no matter what with card on how jobs are going to loss in certain future which mitigate impact from con to a certain extent.


On Climate change 
Pro was able to mitigate impact from Con to a large extent with analysis on why their evidence is marginal on household level and they're able to prove how GAI help student to be more aware of climate change. This is prolly a wash since no team further push forward the tangible impact and the unique comparative on their side.


# Debate 21

## Pro
1 you have really good constructive speech with a clear structure. I suggest you try to be more comparative. Also don't forget to do the weighing in summarybased on your framework. It's very important for the judge to make decisions.

2  Quite good rebuttal speech with clear analysis of nearly all conventions mentioned by con. But actually the environment point from con is actually not related and can be dropped. So I suggest you try to focus more on the main clashes of this round, focusingn giving heavier heavier layers of response Instead of being too hurry to jump from one point to another.

## Con
1 Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence.But I think you kind of lack quiet good team work with your partner, even if you do mentioned quite good point about the unemployment and bias issue of GenAI, however your partner failed to further elaborate on this and kind of just drop this points out. 

2  I really appreciate the job you did in rebuttal part. You have clear analysis and nearly mentioned all the arguments of your opponents and gave quite good responses.I strongly suggest you to be less aggressive in crossfire parts. Try to further engage with your opponents Instead of constantly yelling at your opponents. 

## Final decision
this is a con ballot. This is a very close debate. Two sides are very comparative and the responses and defenses are very pretty good.
Two main clashes in this debate. 
Clash1 accessibility
Pro put forward the contention of accessibility of poor people.  However, This argument is not strongly analyzed, you failed to give concrete data as for to what extent GenAI helps narrow the educational gap and failed to give me clear picture about what are the actual application of AI in poor areas and how is the quality of Gen AI tutoring and why it has more benefits than human teachers?
Many of these concerns are mentioned by a con and remained unsolved. 

Clash2 academic integrity and plagiarism 
Pro side argues that such issues can be avoided, for example, nowadays, teachers can use detective tools to prevent students from cheating. Also, it is not allowed in exams.
Con further argues that students are tempted to use it not only in writing papers, but also in doing assignments which in long-term harms their capabilities, leading to no deep thinking, biased views and less creative and critical, over reliance of students. The scale of negative impact is much bigger.

# Debate 22

## Pro
Speaker 1: A holistic approach to tackling the argument where you explored it from the perspectives of the students and the teachers. Your pieces of evidence were also very relevant to your arguments and rationale. However please avoid interrupting your opponent during crossfire, this is not a good strategy to employ to while away time. Your introduction to your summary was excellent, however it would have been better to establish a correlation to education and the topic.

Speaker 2: What an excellent way to refute your opponent's claims as well as their rebuttals. Additionally, your inclusion of evidence in your rebuttals was a smart move that validated your arguments therefore making them sronger. On crossfire, it would be better if you all ensure professionalism, the back and forth is chaotic and does not surely help both teams. Excellent probing skills during grandcross when you turned the question. Well they proved on the percentage part but you probably failed to hear because of the constant interruption.

## Con
Speaker 1: Excellent contentions that have also been backed by relevant peices of evidence. Your summary was good, however, some of the issues raised seem to have been tackled by your opponent already, you could do well to be more attentive. Excellent evidence provided during gandcross.

Speaker 2: While I appreciate your effort and logic, your rebuttal mostly lacked the necessary warrant to validate them. Also there were times you showed deviation and seem to have not understood your opponent's ideas, this they also emphasized. Additionally, during your rebuttals, some arguments depicted teachers as not part of the education system, are teachers not part? Generally your cross was very chaotic. Please ensure a better approach.

## Final decision
Overall both teams did excellent as they both had great arguments to support their stances, however, on the whole, I buy pro's case as they provided a more holistic approach to addressing this topic, where they only not explored the student's perspective but also that of the teacher, as well as monority population like disabled students and how it eventually benefits the entire society.

# Debate 23

## Pro
1. many of your speech is a bit hard to follow, because the lack of title
2. you need to let your opponent talk during cross!!!!
3. you mentioned "not ai that cause problem, but the use of ai caused" in final focus

## Con
1. definition is good, but need to re-emphasis it a bit more
2. I am hearing a lot good points but does not have enough follow up, for example, when you talk about if student use ai is cheating then why teacher us ai is not. this is a great point but you did not rout back to why in this case ai has more harm then good. 

## Final decision
this debate is a straightforward cost benefit analysis over Gen AI usage on education based, therefore only evidence and arguments about education, both for learning subjects and ethical need, can be accepted.
1. mis usage: although pro mentioned about how Nobel prize winner used AI for their research, but that is still minority case, which cannot stand for all.  con
2. critical thinking: Using AI does not mean abandon teachers  pro
3. ethical: children will have over dependency, and seeking short cuts con
4. Cheating: there is no evidence that what percentage  pro
5. False Information: pro mentioned a 70% false information on ai generative result, no direct feedback

# Debate 24

## Pro
Speaker 1: very high energy delivery. can overcome the teacher shortage. can reduce screen time. data is very centred towards content. adaptive learning. can excess at any time. fluency is good. jobs. 
 well centered questions in cross fire. 
 
 
Speaker 2: confident and vocal. positive gestures as per requirements of content. voice variations are effective. solid references supported with well managed content. personalized learning is possible. effective rebuttal. can ve more fluent in delivery. no conscious mind so biasness is only due to data provided by humans in data bases. 

## Con
Speaker 1: can reduce screen time. too much reliance of AI is damaging for critical thinking. can improve body language or gestures atleast. references are good but not solid enough. biased issues.   energy is low improve to make debate imapctfull. 
 not up to the mark in cross fire. 
 
 
 
Speaker 2: too much screen time. AI is actually is leading to more time usage and over reliance is another issue. lead to reduced student teacher interaction. no new solid contention other than speaker 1.  no body language usage at all. need improvements. 

## Final decision
This is a pro ballot. The pro side is loaded with solid content and data. They manage it very well through effective team work. They negate all points raised or asked by con side. Their contentions like AI can reduce the work load of teachers by 40% and is helpful in learning skills and getting jobs are solid. The point of personalized learning and availability of tools 24/7 is also a plus point. The con side only stayed with lake of critical thinking and biased notation are not enough to negate pro side. Con side need to improve. Good luck to pro side for future as well. 

# Debate 25

## Pro
Good to hear the usage of AI could solve teacher shortage and improve efficiency, accompanied with accessibility of AI use.  Good to rebut the lack of exact proof for AI dependency.

## Con
It’s good to hear over depence and academic integrity of AI use, further restricting critical thinking. Wonderful rebuttal on doubting how AI could improve the academic performance. 

## Final decision
This is a Pro Avenues OL py ballot. 

First of all, I would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!

Clash 1-benefits for people-
Both sides analyzed this clash. Pro did better in establishing that AI usage could not just meet the needs for teachers and mitigate the gap among students, accompanied with assistance for the disabled provided by AI. Con did timeline comparison over impacts of using AI. Comparatively, more layers and stakeholders are concerned by Pro. Comparison in Con’s case is not direct enough for all parts Pro side mentioned since the AI development is irreversible.

# Debate 26

## Pro
Teachers shortage, Accessibility,  
1st: The constructive speech effectively elucidated how the benefits of AI, particularly in addressing teacher shortages and enhancing accessibility, outweigh the harms. This argument was supported by well-cited references and compelling data statistics.
Logically and skillfully defended crossfire, asking good questions.
2nd:  The speaker refuted each of the opponent's arguments with reasoning and supported their stance with relevant data.
The debate was effectively summarized, providing a precise analysis of the main points and clashes, which helped clarify the key arguments for the audience

## Con
Over dependence, Biased Data 
1st: The constructive speech laid a robust groundwork for the harms of AI, particularly focusing on issues of over-dependence and biased data. This foundation effectively highlighted the significant challenges AI poses to education and decision-making.
Crossfire require more solid and logical reasoning  
2nd: During the rebuttal, each contention was systematically addressed with logical reasoning, particularly regarding the workload of teachers.

## Final decision
It was close debate and both teams debated very well. I voted PRO side because 
-The team skillfully navigated the clashes, effectively articulating strong arguments about the impact of biased information and misinformation, as well as the importance of workload relief for teachers. Their points were supported by strong references and logical reasoning.
The CON side also debated very well however 
-the speaker encountered difficulties in delivering effective responses to the questions posed during crossfire and struggled to adequately defend their points about critical thinking and plagiarism.

# Debate 27

## Pro
The pro has confirmed the universality and effectiveness of AI-assisted teaching through discussions with different groups, which can be recognized.One suggestion is to analyze the argument in more depth, such as the reliance on AI mentioned by the con, and whether AI can also improve students'  part of creativity compared to traditional methods

## Con
The logical framework of the con is very clear, but it is more convincing to be careful to give appropriate evidence and consider different stakeholders to show the necessity of the reasons why the harms outweigh the potentials.

## Final decision
The pretty good thing that both sides have done is that each contention is more detailed by offering impact timely. One suggestion is that we should provide empirical evidence rather than just generalization. And more engagements and comparisons are wanted.

# Debate 28

## Pro
for the 1st:
-The arguments that AI can save teachers from administrative tasks and enhance accessibility for students are strong, but the point about economic growth is a bit weak.
-Questioning how many students use GAI for homework wasn't a strong rebuttal. It would have been more effective to mention that monitoring software for GAI usage already exists and is widely implemented in schools, strengthening the counterargument.
for the 2nd：
-Expanding on how GAI can aid students in thinking more critically and deeply effectively highlighted its benefits for learning.
-Mentioning the existence of GAI monitoring software to prevent cheating was a strong rebuttal, effectively countering concerns about misuse and reinforcing the case for AI's positive impact in education.

## Con
for the 1st:
-The concerns that students will cheat using GAI, that it will harm critical thinking, and that GAI may present false information which people may struggle to discern are indeed unique drawbacks of GAI.
-However, the argument did not directly address the issue of student misuse of GAI, and providing data to support this claim would have strengthened the response.
-Your delivery was clear and well-executed, which added strength to your overall argument.
for the 2nd：
- You should include some data on students' over-reliance on AI.

## Final decision
PRO effectively highlighted the support GAI offers to both teachers and students, and since CON did not counter this point, it intuitively stands. The main clash in this debate centered around whether students would use GAI to replace critical thinking, complete assignments, or cheat. While CON pointed out unique drawbacks of GAI, such as cheating and false information, they failed to provide data or usage rates to substantiate these claims. PRO countered by mentioning the existence of AI detection software, which helps prevent cheating, and argued that GAI can enhance student thinking, making their position more convincing overall.

# Debate 29

## Pro
1.the structure of  the constructive speech need a lot work, it is missing a lot data and warrant. 
2. best way to attack a evidence is to come up with a better one, not simply question if the piece is out dated 

## Con
1. divide the time for two contention better, currently they are a bit uneven

## Final decision
although the debate went some what off topic, and went into whether people should neglect AI, or if AI is unique, I will still respect the original topic of a cost benefit analysis
I will vote for con mostly because their summary speech, that although there are some short term benefit that AI can bring as a tool, but people who are using it are the one using it, can indicating significant harm in education especially when children are young and lack of self control. 
In addition, through out the debate con is the side that bring valuable data, although pro questioned some evidence is outdated, but pro came up with less.   

# Debate 30

## Pro
1 Good constructive speech with a clear structure. However, I think you lack engagement In the following parts, you're kind of repeating the mentioned benefits of GenAI. I suggest you try to be more comparative. Also don't forget to do the weighing in summary. It's very important for the judge to make decisions.

2  I really appreciate the job you did in rebuttal part. You have clear analysis and nearly mentioned all the arguments of your opponents and gave quite good responses. However, I suggest you try to combine it with more evidence support. 

## Con

2  I really appreciate the job you did in rebuttal part. You have clear analysis and nearly mentioned all the arguments of your opponents and gave quite good responses. However, I suggest you try to combine it with more evidence support. 

## Final decision
this is a con ballot. This is a very close debate. Two sides are very comparative and the responses and defenses are very pretty good.
Two main clashes in this debate. 
Clash1 job replacement
Pro argue that AI is just doing the assistance job. It won't replace human teachers because human teachers has its own uniqueness. However, I think pro fail to gave clear response to the con's evidence that government are now cutting the budgets and funds of education and teachers are now sufferingrom this.  
Con gave two layers of response. 
1 evidence: With the development of generative AI, government are now cutting funds and capitals in education field. 
2 Students prefer human teachers because they can provide emotional support, which is absent in general AI. This means that the job replacement will lead to further issues, not only to teachers but also to the study of students. 

Clash2 academic integrity
Pro argues that such issue exists before, it's personal choice to use it for evil purpose.
Con Further argues that generative AI actually provide temptation for students to use GenAI to cheat, leading to no deep thinking, biased views and less creative and critical, over reliance of students.

# Debate 31

## Pro
1st speaker: structured and clear contention speech. Good summary speech provided. In the crossfire session, good to ask for the evidence/data to your opponents. 
2nd speaker: Good to point out how AI can possibly promote students’ curiosity and creativity, but if you can prove why your case is more likely to happen, that will be better. 

## Con
1st speaker: there are many arguments provided by con team but each one requires more reasoning/ evidence and impact analysis. for the summary speech, please have more conclusion of your speech, highlight the key points of your team instead of introducing general ideas. 
2nd speaker: in rebuttal speech, try to have more rebuttals instead of giving contentions. You used only 0.5 min in responsing. 

## Final decision
there are several clashes in this round. 1. reducing teachers’ shortage. 2. plagarism. 3. misinformation. pro wins the first argument by providing specifc evidence and impact. for the second and third clashes, no team gives grounded analysis/evidence for the two and I dropped them. 

# Debate 32

## Pro
Your constructive speech was well-structured and easy to follow. You clearly outlined your contentions, especially the benefits of personalized learning through AI and the potential for greater access to educational resources.
You used solid evidence to back up your claims.


## Con
1st speaker: You provided a strong, structured opening that laid out your case against AI in education. Good summary
2nd speaker: In future rebuttals, try to spend more time weighing your impacts against theirs. While you addressed their points, you could further solidify your position by explaining why your teamês benefitsÑlike improving educational access

## Final decision
Pro did a better job by showing huge economic benefits of 10 trillion GPD, and 2% of increase in global GDP, Pro also illustrate quantitative data of 256 million of studets would enjoy higher quality of educational resources by AI. In addition, Pro successfully porved AI eliminate bias, for treating students equally no matter races, gender because there's no human influence. Overall, Pro provided substaintial evidence and well-structed analynize with great logic and impact. 

# Debate 33

## Pro
Zihan: I like the way you present your constructive speech. If I could make one suggestion, debate case is not an informative essay. You can orally label your arguments with titles so that it’s better for judges to comprehend which point/supporting evidence to follow.

Tunan: You are very prepared for this debate and adaptive to questions. Great job!

## Con
Yutong: You also asked excellent questions in crossfire.
Chumin: I love how well-structured your rebuttal speech was. This shows great team-work and preparedness.
[I ran out of space] Both sides, please note that this debate is about the Benefits and Harms of Generative AI in Education. The discussion has been off-topic since the second crossfire.

## Final decision
CON cited a 2022 Stanford study on how generative AI affects students' cognition and critical thinking. PRO argued that (1) the study is outdated due to AI's improvements in the last two years and (2) students still need critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated answers. However, I am convinced when CON presented in their summary speech in which CON explicitly mentioned the problem is AI's limited ideas would restrict students' independent thinking.

# Debate 34

## Pro
Speaker 1: Good and clear case. Nice delivery. The privacy issues raised in the debate is good. Parental confirmation is a good defense.

Speaker 2: The reliance on AI could assist students increase their skills and help educators monitor their learning process. Attacked the bias arguments on uniqueness. Generally the rebuttals are good but the speech could use better organization

## Con
Speaker 1: The speaker could use better delivery and make more eye contact during constructive. Should have better explained the problem with plagiarism in crossfire.

Speaker 2: Could have spent a little more time making defenses. The overall rebuttal is clear. Teachers being replaced by AI is a bad point.


## Final decision
Some of the arguments raised by the con side has some serious topicality issues. Those points are the problems of AI in general. However, the con side failed to set up sufficient link showing how these harms apply to the use of Gen-AI in education. This is a pro ballot because the pro side successfully demonstrated how the use of AI could benefit the realm of education and has more standing impact at the end of the day.

# Debate 35

## Pro
Pro side has given data of teacher shortages and problems of translation in education. But they didn’t prove why it’s important for students to study in a language they’re not familar with.
Strong pathos adapted in rebuttal speech. She is passionate of why AI is cheaper for poor peole to learn at school.

## Con
False information in legal sessions & social media are well supported. It’ll be good if you could link them to educational purpose.
The second point that students fail to think or process information is well supported.
In crossfire, try to stick to your own argument of information accuracy when answering questions posted by pro concerning prices.
In rebuttal, also try to point out why the problems caused by AI such as false information outweighs the benefits.
It’s great that the first speaker realizes the problems and pointed out how biased/misleading information harms students.


## Final decision
Both team didn’t make clear comparasion of why the harm or benefit of AI applied in education OUTWEIGHS the oppo side. They used most of the time to defend their own arguments but seldom engage with the other side. In comparasion pro does a slightly better job in stating why short of teachers stops students from receiving education.

# Debate 36

## Pro
Team SHFLS ZL Wins.

## Con
Team National Day TJ  : FORFEIT

## Final decision
None

# Debate 37

## Pro
1st: The first sentence doesn't seem particularly necessary. The opening paragraph doesn't directly contribute to the contentions. There’s no clear connection between the contention and education, or it should more clearly point out how it can be applied in education and explain the further benefits. Not all AI is generative AI.
2nd: It was good to mention the content of the crossfire, but possibly due to preparation issues, the effectiveness wasn’t great. The first response still didn’t target the core of the resolution; the second point was well addressed. You need to understand AI and generative AI correctly.

## Con
1st: Not quite familiar with the cases yet. There should be some background information, definitions, frameworks, etc., in the cases, not just contentions. When using evidence to support contentions, it’s best to mention the source to help establish the credibility of the evidence. The second point didn't mention the impact. The third point can be linked to the first point with logical explanation. In the crossfire, focus more on questioning the evidence rather than simply asking the other side’s opinion. The Summary didn’t include content from the rebuttal speech.

2nd: The first sentence is great, directly highlighting the problem with the con side. The response was also well done, pointing out differences in the evidence found and specifically mentioning the source, which makes it more convincing.

## Final decision
Con side: Although the con side still has many areas for improvement in this debate, overall, their understanding of the resolution is more thorough than the pro side. There is room for improvement in debate techniques, but their overall data collection was well done. The pro side needs to further understand the resolution and clarify the relationship between AI and generative AI. However, the pro 2nd did very well in the Summary, and could consider expanding it into their cases.

# Debate 38

## Pro
Speaker # 1 delivery clear but reading most of the time with very little eye contact into camera.
Speaker # 1 presneted their case with 3 main contentions on accessibility, personalized learning and  benefiting teaching with Gen AI with good logics and evidence.
Speaker # 2 rebutall speech was excellent in refuting opponent case contentions one by one with good logical reasoning specially on its not Gen AI fault for accessibility problem and plagrism.

## Con
Speaker # 1 delivery clear and well projected.
Speaker # 1 presented their case with  two main contentions on  accesibility and plagrism with good logic and evidence. 
Speaker # 2 rebutall speech could be better in refuting opponent case contentions one by one as your speech was much more strengthing and some repeatition of construtive speech.
I like your case but once pro side refuted that how the uniqueness of Gen AI being at fault for lack of internet access and plagrism as these problem root cause is not GEN AI.

## Final decision
Both the sides were very good but I voted for PRO side because of the following reasons.
Its people problem to inappropiately use AI but not Gen AI problem.
1. Accessbility. No fundamental problem in Gen AI for providing 24/7 education that is cheaper (3 times less) with 1o to 25 dollars that in person education that cost 25 to 100 dollars per hour.  Gen AI provide personalized learning. Con side argued that  37% or 2.9 billion donot have access to internet that lead to wealth or social gap. Pro side argued that its not Gen AI problem, Education inequality exist without Gen AI its poverty problem. Already 20% of world popolation donot have access to education. Pro side won this clash with better logical reasoning. and its not GEN AI fault.
2.Plagrism. Con side argued that Gen AI increase academic dishonesty and over relience on Gen AI. Pro side argued that academic dishonesty exist with and without Gen AI. Con side failed to prove the uniques.

## Final decision
SH SAS YL disappears after Pro’s constructive speech and never came back.
They are forfeited for the round.

# Debate 40

## Pro
Constructive speech: 1. Students: Critical thinking ability 2.Teachers- Productivity and support 3. University research
 1 Speaker : You did great with the constructive speech, you understood the topic and you presented clearly well done.
2 Speaker: You did great with rebuttal, you were able to recognize the weakness of your opponents and used to defend your teams especially in a asking the specific questions.

## Con
Constructive speech: 1.Unfare distribution, 2. Biased 3. Independence in learning
1 Speaker: I think you did great with the constructive speech and you were a little not ready for the cross fire questions  from your  opponent.
2 Speaker:You rebutted well the points of the opponents, and your points were valid except that you were to add more confidence and also emphasize on your facts and impacts.

You did great , but your opponents outweighted your points today. I suggest that you use all the cards you have with all confidence and quantifiable  results or impacts .

## Final decision
The clash in this debate was education, and weather AI brings more impacts.  Team PRO managed to provide the facts and impacts  on each of there constructive points and that they were able to provide the  percentage example the increase of the academic efficientcy about 54% for students and how itswas able to reduce anxiety by 30% percentage, thus answers the points raised bt the CON team on emotional bias in education. 

# Debate 41

## Pro
Both the speakers delivery was clear but very little eye contact into the camera.
Speaker # 1 presented their case with two main contentions on personalized learning and  AI supports teachers with scheduling and data management with good logic and evidence.
Speaker # 1 respones in crossfire # 1 were weak on how Gen AI benefits student with disabilities.
Speaker # 2 rebutall on questioning cyber warfare linkage AI based eduction.
Rebutall on deep fakes, impact on human learning with Gen AI could be better and no response on sexual abuse by Gen AI in schools.

## Con
Both the speakers delivery was clear and well projected.
Speaker # 1 presented their case with main contentions on privacy concern because of Gen AI on targeting childern with sexual assults, bullying, cyber attacks, impact on human extinction and bais in Gen AI data sets with good logical reasoning and evidence.
Speaker # 2 rebutall speech was good in refuting opponent case contentions on by one with good logic and counter evidence. Specially response on  Gen AI accessibilty to disable students was good with 460 million students worldwise lacks access to internet.
Speaker # 2 

## Final decision
I voted for Con side because of the following reasons.
1.Inequality and bais in Data set used by Gen AI that impacts minorities. that leads to misinformation to next generation of students that leads to corruption in education system.
2. Deep fakes because of Gen AI cause misinformation content creation. Increase in cyber bullying because of Gen AI. Gen AI cause more cyber attacks and data breaches. 90 % of eductional institutes are facing cyber attacks.
3. Negative impact on human races with too much relience on Gen AI to perform all the tasks of human intelligence for example like essay writings.

# Debate 42

## Pro
1st:
The arguments are comprehensive and provides strong evidence. Some points, especially regarding personalized learning and inclusivity, are repeated. Condensing these ideas would make the argument sharper. Integrating a rebuttal to potential drawbacks would make the case more balanced.
2nd:
You could try using better debate techniques to respond to misinformation. For example, education is not just about pointing out what is correct; incorrect information is also a form of education, which can train critical thinking skills.

## Con
1nd:
Strong Structure. Effectively connect the negative consequences of AI—such as misinformation and isolation—with broader societal impacts like diminished communication skills and empathy.
2nd:
The argument could be more organized. Some points are repeated, and the structure isn't always clear. Break the rebuttal into clear sections (e.g., clarify misunderstanding, address their points on adaptive learning, address efficiency, and then wrap up with a conclusion). The mention of education in conflict zones, while important, seems somewhat off-topic. When addressing their contention about adaptive learning, you mention that AI cannot manage a class. Instead of just stating potential problems, explain why AI can't replace face-to-face interaction effectively.


## Final decision
A difficult decision. Overall, I believe both the pro and con sides performed very well, providing solid evidence, credible sources, and clear logical links to explain their points. Both sides also have areas for improvement, as noted above. Ultimately, I vote for the pro side because they were nearly flawless in every aspect, though the con side also did an excellent job.

# Debate 44

## Pro
Overall lacks evidence in your constructive. Needs to be a lot more substantive and argumentative on the practical benefits, with clear depiction of what AI does or can do in education. Could ask better questions in 1cf.
In rebuttal, be clearer with signposting. 
More comparison is needed. Particularly, illustrate better how AI is used as a tool and that the critical thinking impediment is not happening. So far your side only introduces some AI functions without discussing potential checks on abuse.

## Con
Constructive: delivery could be clearer. Overall needs more evidence. Fine explanation on loss of problem-solving skills. On cheating: despite the bad moral connotation of cheating, you still need to answer why is increased cheating a worse social phenomenon? It could well lead to a different academic ethic.
Overall fine summary. Good signpost. Fine comparison on AI and critical thinking/decisionmaking skills. 

## Final decision
Overall a con ballot, mostly for the impediment of critical thinking. I personally do not buy increased cheating as an impact in and of itself if thereês no further moral argument or social impacts explained, but that does back up the claim that people rely heavily on AI and thus retard their problem solving skills. Pro mostly stays on the simple assertion that AI is only a tool and that creativity needs to come from human, but little analysis is done on the culture of creativity or how exactly people enhance thinking capacities by the help of AI. Co-development of AI and human learning is not explained to its material details.

# Debate 45

## Pro
First speaker :Confident speech, in your case you use specific data to show how AI affect the educational system. Providing clear framework to outweigh the con side. Good job! Excellent cf skill point out the deficiency of evidence from con side. Perfect summary! Good evidence check.

Second speaker:
Excellent rebuttal! Clear structure and sufficient evidence. Tracking all the issues and solve them. Confident speech and excellent rebuttal skill. Clear and effective response in cf. 

## Con
Frist speaker: Good structure of case. Clear points. Add framework and specific data. Be more familiar with your evidence link. Asking more effective questions in cf. Do more weighing in summary. 

Second speaker:
Good expansion of your side contention. Trying to rebuttal opposite side points. Adding more statistic data or evidence in rebuttal. Trying to give more effective response or direct data during cf. 

## Final decision
Two reasons for voting:
1. Pro side has better framework and statistic data to show their contentions. Con side did not provide evidence link during evidence check. Pro side successfully prove their points and impact.
2. During summary, pro side gives several points and extension of impact. Pro prove their contention and logic. Con side fail to weigh the impact of Al in educational system. Also Pro give voting points in ff and summary. Pro win this debate. 

# Debate 46

## Pro
1st speaker: great delivery.you did a great job framing your cases
2nd speaker: you did a great job of making your impacts clear in the final focus, moving forward, spend a bit more time comparing your impacts, nice job collapsing onto the most critical issue in the cross fire. 

## Con
1st speaker: well-organized constructive speech. well-targeted questions raised in cross fire. Great summary of clash points.
2nd speaker: responded to your opponents' cases efficiently, great use of evidence from APA to convince education needs human interaction, and engaging with real people. 

## Final decision
for con refuting the first contention of pro, it's not that valid for stating that's not a "unique" point, and the rebuttal of teachers should abusing and provide guidance for students use AI in a positive way is more likely a solution for side-effects, not that directly prove AI tools itself is beneficial, which is wage.
Con did a better job by addressing most of pro's arguments and refutes valid. Con convering AI could be a supplement tool but not replace the traditional educational implements. 
Even if both side show their impact, Con is more persuasiive by weighing a greater impact: the hard regulation on misinformation, harms students' decision-making, critical thinking ability, and more serious ethical concerns of academic integrity, these have a huge impact because academic integrity lead to grievous consequence on student. Plus, CON successfully proved the potential benefits cannot outweigth harms. 

# Debate 47

## Pro
First speaker:
Clear and effectie constructive speech! Sufficient statistic data and evidence in order to show the Al utilization in educational system. Pointing the dropping contentions in summary. Good job!

Second speaker:
Good rebuttal. Try to give more directive evidence to against the oponent side. Asking more effective questions during cf. Giving more voting issue in ff.

## Con
First speaker:
Clear case. Good response and questioning in cf. Excellent performance in grand cf. 


Second speaker:
Excellent rebuttal! Tracking all the points from pro side. Giving significant evidence and data. Good extension of your own side contention in the final part of rebuttal. Excellent cf skill. Great ff. Well done!

## Final decision
This round is a very close round. Both teams are very good.
Above con side has better extension and weighing . I vote for con.
Con side has better extension and framework to prove their logic. And pro side need improve the logic explaination in cf or rebuttal. The thesis between evidence and impact need more exploration. 
Pro side focus on the long-term impact. But pro side fail to clearify how long-term impact significant. 
Con side giving more reasonable voting issue in ff. Above I vote for con side. 

# Debate 48

## Pro
The 1st speaker:
The constructive speech isn’t well-built, try to brainstorm more with your teammate and establish more arguments with more evidence supports. Also it sounds like you’re not familiar with your contents. Try to take part in mock rounds more and discuss with more people.

The 2nd speaker:
Try to bring more researches and attack opponents pointss.

## Con
Active questions during the crossfire. You could try to use questions to guide your opponent to your own arguments.

The con side has stated how AI will possibly make it harder for students to improve in the process of learning.

## Final decision
Con wins because they did a better job ellaborating why AI has caused more trouble to students. Pro side is comparatively reluctant and not sure of their own arguments throughout the whole round.

# Debate 49

## Pro
The pro side has provided the usage of AI in multiple occasions deriving from educational assistance for disabled students to job training occasions with proper data support.
The statements of AI could provide guidances and they are under control of human works as effective rebuttals.
The “anti-plagiarism also progresses” might be a weak response comparatively. 

## Con
The con side has pointed out possible concerns of AI usage but didn’t provide enouge data or evidence support.

The rebuttal speech is also established on assumptions or descriptions. Evidence is needed in PF debate. It’s easy for the opponent to rebut your arguments if you don’t have ANY data support.

## Final decision
The con side fails to provide any proof to their arguments. They didn’t provide how AI will harm the creativity of students after pro side rebuts with a) human are still there, ai serves as a tool, b) AI has the potential to also provide guidances.

The pro side is clear in stating how AI improves the performances of students and provides options for disabled students. The additional benefits of economical benefit & medical assitances (after training) are also not rebutted by the CON at all.

# Debate 50

## Pro
First speaker:
Clear constructive speech. Good explaination to Al system. The skill that Al can provide for teachers and students. Excellent cf skill. Clear summary of clashes and weighing. 

Second speaker:
Excellent rebuttal. Clearify the logic and contention. Tracking all the opponent contentions. Good job! Great cf skill. Excellent evidence-checking and call back in grand crossfire. Effective ff good job! 

## Con
First speaker:
Clear and powerful constructive speech! Sufficient specific data and direct evidence. Confident speech. Excellent response in cf.
Very good summary of pointing the dropping points and effectiveness. Try to use more effective way to explain your side logic. 

Second speaker:
Confident speech and powerful rebuttal. Giving data and mitigation to the pro side. The extension of accessibility accuracy and climate change. Good response in cf. Try to use more effective way to explain your side logic. 

## Final decision
This round is a very close round. Both teams are well done!
1. climate change. Pro side has successfully weighing this point using evidence and analysis. Con side fail to explain the clear logic between climate change and Al . Pro win this point. 
2. Pro side has better extension of their contention and outweighing almost opponent points. Con side fail to defend their own points and give clear link between Al and environmental issues. But pro also drop the bias issue from con side.
Above all I vote for pro. 


# Debate 51

## Pro
1. I do appreciate the first point about how AI can help solve inequality issues. It's unclear to me why human AI translation point is important when it can possibly lead to unemployment. To what extend translation is important for education in general, should be explained more. I do appreciate the further explanation that understanding is the precondition to learn things better, but to what extend that we need to use another language to learn as a norm is unclear. 
2.Rebuttal speech is good, in terms of dislink cheating,you successfully point out that it's not unique. It's better to engage better in terms of better grades and critical thinking problems con side gives, to better weigh that even if students rely too much, better grades in general are more important.

## Con
1.con side's point about decreasing critical thinking, ethnical privacy, and the culture of cheating. For the second point, to what extend it's likely to happen, and to what extend the culture of cheating is uniquely caused by AI is unclear to me.
2.During crossfire, you can ask questions about the things u didn't hear it clearly during the case constructive. Questions can also be about attacking the mechanism, asking for logic link, and metric, doing weighing.
3.summary speech can also rebuild your case i.e. when your opponents attack your points, it's better to rebuild your case e.g. why cheating is uniquely much worse etc. What's more, it's important to prove the link of privacy issues in order to make the impact stands.

## Final decision
this is a pro ballot. First, for the clash of losing critical thinking ability vs. more accessibility of education. I vote for pro because the impact of accessibility proven by pro side have greater scope and more importance in terms of more students can have access to education with profound impacts. Even if critical thinking ability has some decrease, accessibility still is more profound, especially the better performance can happen on pro side. Second, the harm of AI of con side for example, privacy concern, culture of cheating, for privacy concern the likelihood of it happens and the severity are not well-established. The uniqueness of culture of cheating is not well-proven as well, therefore it's really hard for me the weigh it important in this round, and how to weigh it against the better accessibility on pro side is unclear to me. In terms of impact weighing, the impact of pro side is proven in a more tangible way.

# Debate 52

## Pro
1st speaker: persuative speech, well-structed framework. you raised concise questions that forced your opponents to defend their arguments. Impressive Summary speech
2nd speaker: great define of clarifying grammar tool is not belong to generative AI, your rebuttal is convincing by showing the quantitative data and comparison. 

## Con
1st speaker: strong and valid evidence is supported your arguments. 
2nd speaker: excellent analysis, solid evidence are provided in your rebuttal speech, your final focus speech was sharpand tp the clash point. 

## Final decision
Even if the Con eliminated the problems from AI, but the pre condition is to admited these side effect would take place. 
Con showed a great impact on how AI exaggerates bias, plagorism, over relience. Con succesfully convinced the argument on ethical concerns which hasn't be refute by Pro. Overall, Con wins by showing a greater impact on racial bias (more than 50% of are underrepressented), and don't have the access to Internet which prove those benefits from AI could not even happen. Overall, even though two side both gave persuasive speech, Ivote for Con because they showed more urgent, severity, quantitative impact, and long-term consequences. 

# Debate 53

## Pro
Educational accessibility, efficiency and accuracy,  were discussed in the constructive speech with clarity and supported by well-cited references, data, facts, and figures. 
The speaker skillfully navigated the crossfire round by posing insightful questions.
During rebuttal, each point of contention was skillfully addressed with logical reasoning and backed by numerous statistical data
Furthermore, the debate was effectively summarized, offering a precise analysis of the critical clashes and arguments during the final focus.

## Con
Dependency on technology, Biased/Inaccurate data, Lack of creativity and innovation 
The constructive speech laid out a comprehensive framework based on the lack of critical thinking, specifically emphasizing the accuracy of data. Adding additional data and facts, however, could strengthen the persuasiveness  of the presented arguments. 
Crossfire needs additional logical reasoning which could bolster the arguments further.
In the rebuttal phase, every contention was skillfully tackled with logical reasoning 
The summary part of the debate can be improved to create a stronger impact by concisely reinforcing the key arguments and highlighting their significance.

## Final decision
Reasons for voting on the PRO side include
-their efficient handling of clashes about accuracy of AI particularly in relation to teachers, was commendable. They succeeded in their arguments due to robust logical reasoning supported by pertinent data statistics.
Contrarily, the CON side had interesting debate but 
-exhibited a deficiency in reasoning, particularly evident during the crossfire rounds especially coating contradicting statement against their own arguments

# Debate 54

## Pro
The pro side has provided solid data support in constructive speech. The clashes were established by the 1st speaker clearly in summary. Strong rebuttal of generative AI applied in educational phase could be different from in other usages.

Both debaters did great job in applying ethos pathos and logos throughout the whole debate.

## Con
The con side has provided detailed example of AI cannot replicate the complicated real-life situation to students so that it doesn’t help students develop their skills.

Also you were great throughout the whole round untill at the very last moment. 

Pro did a slightly better final focuse in analysing the impacts of how to use AI as an educational tool.

## Final decision
It was a tough round! It was difficult to make the final decision. I was considering voting for CON team at first when they’ve pointed out that students cannot perform well in real world if they’re trained by the AI. Also privacy issue could be a larger problem for users. But later on PRO side did a great job stating that if students don’t get a chance to learn the correct way of using AI, larger problems will occur. 

Congrats for both Pro and Con because all of you did really good in this round!!!

# Debate 55

## Pro
1.I love the structure of the case, it's clear two points one is about better education for everyone, the other is about more convenience. It's better to tell me the weighing metrice or framework, what metric or framing you want to use in this debate.
2.during rebuttal speech, the definition is not that important, it's already pretty clear. The whole rebuttal speech, when you talk about how a holistic person has other traits it's so confusing how on your side it's better, the rebuttals are not that valid in the critical thinking, over-reliance, I dont see how on your side the benefits can weighing over those bad impacts.
3.teachers are symmetrical in this round, on your side you have emotional building, on con side, they have it as well. Such push is not valid enough to directly deny the reliance, because it may get worse for those lazy students, and more students in general. it's better to way and buy their worst case, and do comparison, buy their worst case, why your impacts are still more important.

## Con
1.the wording of second contentions can be how AI makes cheating worse, how it's hard to scrutinize and why it's bad. You can reinforce the over-reliance it's a norm.
2.I do love the rebuttal speech, you can make it clearer that directly weighing against all the best impact of education, why misinformation, stereotype, accuracy problems are more detrimental, why on your side you are gradually improving on accessibility without AI as well. This could be helpful

## Final decision
I eventually believe this is a con ballot. This debate is extremly closed. Neither side engage in an effective way or frame this debate to make their impacts more convincing. Pro side tries to state that AI brings benefits for all the students providing high quality customized and 24/7 learning experience, giving teacher more time for creative teaching etc. To make this debate charitable, to achieve pro's impacts, using AI is inevitable, which leads to the bad impacts of con side that students may over rely on AI losing decision making ability, making cheating worse etc. To this point, the debate is a tie. The way I viewed it is that con's arguments are mitigation towards pro's good impacts. Neither of the teams frame their impacts as the most important one in this debate. But one material from con's rebuttal speech of misinformation, stereotypes, inaccurate information is unrebutted and intact. I eventually see this material as the one that con buying the best case of accessibility and qualified education, wide spread misinformation could even be more detrimental overall. Therefore, there is one extra harm from con side that is not rebutted and strong. Eventually, con.

# Debate 56

## Pro
Pro side’s constructive speech lacks data and evidence to support.
This is a PF debate where it not only requires the use of logic and reasoning but more importantly the utilization of effective data and evidence to support your claim. You can get familiar with this type of debate and spend more time doing reserach and finding information which makes your speech stronger.


## Con
Great constructive speech supported by sufficient amount of evidence and data.
Great combination of logic and evidence during the speech, since PRO side didn’t use any evidence during the whole speech your point automatically stand. But also keep in mind to make the structure of your constructive more concise, trying to make each of the subpoint clearly as you contains a lot of information in it.


## Final decision
The result of the debate is lean towards the CON side due to Pro side ’s insufficient amount use of data and evidence.
Con side has a better performance in crossfire round as Pro side could not use any effective evidence to tackle against CON.
Since Pro side could not provide data and evidence to tackle against CON’s 3 contention, the 3 point all stand.




# Debate 57

## Pro
The logic of how AI assist teachers in education is clearly established.

Need more data support for the points of why AI improves students’ performances at school.

Try to weigh the impacts of benefits/harms brought by AI.

Pay attention the example you’ve raised belongs to the category of generative AI or not.

## Con
The signal might be unstable when you’re outside.
Overall the arguments are well-constructed but your side also need more data/evidence support.

Try to bring out how severe the harm is that the benefits cannot trade off.

## Final decision
There isn’t enough engagments in the round. Both sides are restating their own points over and over again. Also, both side need to weigh impacts during summary and final focus, which I didn’t hear any.

Pro did slightly better in ellaborating how AI asists teachers in the educational field.

# Debate 58

## Pro
Great Constructive speech with solid amount use of data and evidence, might improve concision by making subpoint clearly during the speech. 
Maybe stick to your point, especially your third contention it seems that after the evidence check you seems to drop this argument

## Con
Great constructive speech supported by data and evidence.
Great performance in evidence check, well-prepared
Thought-provoking question being raised in cross-fire round.


## Final decision
Con side’s 1st contention of misinformation counters Pro’s 1st contention of personalized learning, where pro has insufficient evidence to proof the problem of misinformation. 
Con successfully rebut the point of Pro’s 3rd contention
Pro provides a better logic about the how AI boost academic performance and boost diversity(disability）
Con provides better logical justification to counter Pro’s 1, 2 contention




# Debate 59

## Pro
Sufficient amount of logic and evidence during the constructive speech nicely done!
Great rebuttal and during crossfire round by using a layer by layer structure which provides both evidence, reasoning and consession.


## Con
Might be able to incorporate more evidences and data in your constructive speech
Lack of responses during the crossfire round
Your claim should be supported by data and evidence instead of pure logical justification
Also one point being dropped due to evidence check

## Final decision
In general the decision is lean towards pro side naturally due to con side provides insufficient amount of evidence throughout the whole debate and also lose one of the evidence check
Con side lacks effective rebuttal towards Pro side’s 3 contention
Pro’s contention 3 automatically dropped as the important evidence from stf university lacks authenticity

# Debate 60

## Pro
Personalized Learning, Reduce work load for Teachers, 
1st: The constructive speech effectively elucidated how the benefits of AI outweigh the harms, supported by well-cited references and compelling data statistics. 
Crossfire require more solid and logical reasoning  
2nd: During the rebuttal, each contention was systematically addressed with logical reasoning, reflecting a strong grasp of the topic supported by several data facts and statistics, 
The debate was effectively summarized, offering a precise analysis of the main points and clashes 

## Con
Dependency, Privacy, Job situation and devaluation, Quality of Education, 
1st: The constructive speech laid a robust groundwork for the harms of AI, particularly focusing on issues of dependency and the quality of education. 
Logically and skillfully defended crossfire, asking good questions.
The speaker refuted each of the opponent's arguments with reasoning and supported their stance with relevant data. However, there is room for improvement in providing even more solid and logical reasoning

## Final decision
I voted for PRO side because 
-The team exhibited adept handling of clashes, particularly in presenting compelling arguments regarding dependency and workload relief for teachers. Their points were underpinned by strong references and logical reasoning, which bolstered their position and effectively countered opposing viewpoints.
The CON side also debated well however 
-the speaker encountered difficulties in delivering effective responses to the questions posed during crossfire 
-also failed to adequately defend their points about dependency and privacy, missing opportunities to provide supporting evidence or examples that would strengthen their argument.

# Debate 61

## Pro
CI is relatively well-rounded. But is Duolingo/grammarly Gen AI? Need a lot better conception of GenAI and its uniqueness. Overall doesnêt tell much of what AI could do exactly in edu uniquely. 
Fine rebuttal, though could note your word economy. 
Pro second speaker PLEASE BE CIVIL DURING GCF.

## Con
Overall need much better explanation of what AI does and distinguish Gen AI w/ other internet usage. I assume cyberattack and cybersecurity issue has always been present? that AI exacerbates should not be assumed. Data breach: needs to extend practical harm with illustrative examples.. Link between AI and sexual abuse is existent but weak. Only link is AI creating indecent pictures. That does not access to the full sex abuse and suicide impact. The slippery slope argument on extinction shows no logical slope. 

## Final decision
I donêt think both sides really debated much on AI. No one in this debate room showed good understanding of Gen AI. Very little uniqueness shown overall.
I do not think con meets topicality for most of their arguments. They only relied on slippery slope of çany encouragement of AI will lead to extinction,é and they never really showed any slope or even testimony. Only remote con impact I can take is data security, but they didnêt show the unique impact of genAI. I mostly take proês CI on AI enhancing academic peformance/productivity, even though this was somehow not prominent in later debate. Conês rebuttal argument on loss of creativity/dependence wouldnêt counter the full weight.

# Debate 62

## Pro
Good observation on edu gap. But should strengthen link between AI and increase of access. Mere proclamation of personalized learning does not suffice.
First speaker should grab a chance to speak in cf.
Rebuttal could use better signposting and organization. Overall needs more evidence backing.
Fine summary. Good point on specialization, but could be more detailed in its mechanism. Be more concise with AT bias.

## Con
overall well-argued case. Interesting examples of false beliefs. Would appreciate more if you give clearer indication on the generation of these. more explanation should be given on the extent and degree of çfalsityé of information AI provides.
Overall good rebuttal. Good flow of delivery. But overall too defensive and only mitigative. Just because AI doesnêt replace teachers in empathetic guidance, doesnêt mean it worsens teacher-student relationship. Needs to be clearer and substantive on the offense. Should engage more with pro summary on teaching efficiency and teacher time-allocation.

## Final decision
Close debate, overall con ballot. I do think pro has more intuitively acceptable argument, but the link is considerably weak with relatively little evidence for support, thus the impact is not best visualized. Con has relatively well-rounded argumentation on data bias and convincingly showed that AI could expose the next generation of students to false information. I do nonetheless think that con could go deeper on the unsolvability of this problem instead of assuming that AI will not be under close scrutiny. 

# Debate 63

## Pro
Great constructive speech overall, I like how you build on each of your argument.
Make sure not easily drop your point by saying words like we expect, especially on the point of internet acess where you give a prediction of the scenario in 2024. This will largely jeopardize your convincingness
Try to use more logic to build on your argument as well as refuting opponents.

## Con
Try to finish the 3rd contention in the constructive speech
Great performance in the crossfire round.
Great use of logic to attack pro’s argument and also very well prepared evidence to respond Pro’s argument
Please be more mindful in Grand Cross (not too rush)

## Final decision
Con side wins on accuracy issue as pro side doesn’t provide enough evidence 
Con wins on academic honesty issue by providing sufficient amount of evidence of usage of offline test.
Pro side lacks clarification of their evidence especialy crossfire round which lead to a lot of point being dropped. (Lack of information to prove the accessibility of AI worldwide 40%)
Con wins on the efficiency clash since it points out the inconnectiveness between efficency and better academic performance
