1. the structure of  the constructive speech need a lot work, it is missing a lot data and warrant. 
2. best way to attack a evidence is to come up with a better one, not simply question if the piece is out dated
## Sakura Chen
Zihan: I like the way you present your constructive speech. If I could make one suggestion, debate case is not an informative essay. You can orally label your arguments with titles so that it’s better for judges to comprehend which point/supporting evidence to follow.

Tunan: You are very prepared for this debate and adaptive to questions. Great job!
## Jiayi Shi
1. Good constructive speech with a clear structure. However, I think you lack engagement. In the following parts, you're kind of repeating the mentioned benefits of GenAI. I suggest you try to be more comparative. Also don't forget to do the weighing in summary. It's very important for the judge to make decisions.
2.  I really appreciate the job you did in rebuttal part. You have clear analysis and nearly mentioned all the arguments of your opponents and gave quite good responses. However, I suggest you try to combine it with more evidence support.


# Con: Other SP
## Shirley Xu
1. divide the time for two contention better, currently they are a bit uneven
## Sakura Chen
Yutong: You also asked excellent questions in crossfire.

Chumin: I love how well-structured your rebuttal speech was. This shows great team-work and preparedness.

[I ran out of space] Both sides, please note that this debate is about the Benefits and Harms of Generative AI in Education. The discussion has been off-topic since the second crossfire.

Editor's note: I have no idea why they just copypasted the Pro feedback to here in the document

# Final decision
## Shirley Xu: Con
although the debate went some what off topic, and went into whether people should neglect AI, or if AI is unique, I will still respect the original topic of a cost benefit analysis

I will vote for con mostly because their summary speech, that although there are some short term benefit that AI can bring as a tool, but people who are using it are the one using it, can indicating significant harm in education especially when children are young and lack of self control. 

In addition, through out the debate con is the side that bring valuable data, although pro questioned some evidence is outdated, but pro came up with less.
## Sakura Chen: Con
CON cited a 2022 Stanford study on how generative AI affects students' cognition and critical thinking. PRO argued that (1) the study is outdated due to AI's improvements in the last two years and (2) students still need critical thinking to evaluate AI-generated answers. However, I am convinced when CON presented in their summary speech in which CON explicitly mentioned the problem is AI's limited ideas would restrict students' independent thinking.
## Jiayi Shi: Con
this is a con ballot. This is a very close debate. Two sides are very comparative and the responses and defenses are very pretty good.

Two main clashes in this debate. 
### Clash 1: job replacement
Pro argue that AI is just doing the assistance job. It won't replace human teachers because human teachers has its own uniqueness. However, I think pro fail to gave clear response to the con's evidence that government are now cutting the budgets and funds of education and teachers are now sufferingrom this.  

Con gave two layers of response. 

1. With the development of generative AI, government are now cutting funds and capitals in education field. 
2. Students prefer human teachers because they can provide emotional support, which is absent in general AI. This means that the job replacement will lead to further issues, not only to teachers but also to the study of students. 
### Clash 2:
Pro argues that such issue exists before, it's personal choice to use it for evil purpose.

Con Further argues that generative AI actually provide temptation for students to use GenAI to cheat, leading to no deep thinking, biased views and less creative and critical, over reliance of students.

# ChatGPT summary
The debate topic is whether the benefits of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education outweigh the harms. After reviewing the feedback and judging notes from the debate, here's a summary:

### **Decision: Con Wins (All Judges)**

The debate revolved around two main clashes:

---

### **Clash 1: Job Replacement in Education**

- **Pro's Argument:**
  - GenAI can assist rather than replace teachers because of the unique qualities that human educators possess, such as emotional intelligence and support for students.

- **Con's Argument:**
  - Con presented evidence that governments are cutting budgets for education due to the increasing role of AI, which could lead to job losses for teachers.
  - The lack of emotional support from AI was also highlighted, reinforcing the argument that reliance on AI would harm students’ learning experience by removing human interactions.

- **Judges’ Evaluation:**
  - Pro failed to provide a strong rebuttal to Con’s evidence on budget cuts in education and the emotional role of teachers. Con successfully layered their arguments by demonstrating both the financial and emotional impacts of AI in education.

---

### **Clash 2: Over-reliance and Cheating with GenAI**

- **Pro's Argument:**
  - The potential harms of GenAI, like cheating, exist in all technologies, and it’s ultimately up to the students to decide how they use these tools.
  - GenAI can still foster critical thinking as students need to evaluate and improve AI-generated responses.

- **Con's Argument:**
  - GenAI can lead to an over-reliance that reduces students’ critical and creative thinking abilities.
  - It presents a new temptation for students to cheat, and young students, in particular, may lack the self-control to resist these temptations.
  - Con further argued that GenAI’s limited ideas could restrict students’ independent thinking and creativity.

- **Judges’ Evaluation:**
  - Judges found Con’s argument about GenAI leading to a loss of deep thinking, creativity, and reliance on biased outputs more convincing.
  - The claim that GenAI reduces students' cognitive development was bolstered by Con's evidence, including a 2022 Stanford study, which outweighed Pro’s defense that AI has improved since then.

---

### **Overall Analysis:**

- **Pro Strengths:** 
  - Pro did a good job framing GenAI as a supportive tool rather than a replacement for human teachers. They also argued that AI can enhance education if used properly, though this argument needed more specific data and examples.

- **Pro Weaknesses:** 
  - Pro's rebuttals lacked strong evidence to counter Con's claims about job replacement and the negative cognitive effects of GenAI. 
  - They didn’t address Con’s arguments with newer or more robust data, which weakened their position on both short-term and long-term harms.

- **Con Strengths:** 
  - Con successfully provided solid evidence and analysis, especially in relation to the financial consequences of AI in education and its impact on students' cognitive abilities.
  - They maintained a well-structured argument and had strong responses to Pro’s claims, especially in the final summary.

---

### **Final Decision:**

All three judges sided with Con due to the strength of their evidence and analysis. While Pro highlighted some potential benefits of GenAI, the harms presented by Con—particularly around over-reliance, cognitive development, and job losses in education—were more convincing. Judges also noted that Pro needed stronger evidence to refute Con’s key points effectively.

**Winner: Con**
