# Pro: Avenues OL PY
## Zaiqi Zhang
Speaker 1: Good and clear case. Nice delivery. The privacy issues raised in the debate is good. Parental confirmation is a good defense.

Speaker 2: The reliance on AI could assist students increase their skills and help educators monitor their learning process. Attacked the bias arguments on uniqueness. Generally the rebuttals are good but the speech could use better organization
## Zi Ling
Your constructive speech was well-structured and easy to follow. You clearly outlined your contentions, especially the benefits of personalized learning through AI and the potential for greater access to educational resources.

You used solid evidence to back up your claims.
## Yinyin Zhao
1st speaker: structured and clear contention speech. Good summary speech provided. In the crossfire session, good to ask for the evidence/data to your opponents. 

2nd speaker: Good to point out how AI can possibly promote students’ curiosity and creativity, but if you can prove why your case is more likely to happen, that will be better.
# Con: SZ S&T Town FW
## Zaiqi Zhang
Speaker 1: The speaker could use better delivery and make more eye contact during constructive. Should have better explained the problem with plagiarism in crossfire.

Speaker 2: Could have spent a little more time making defenses. The overall rebuttal is clear. Teachers being replaced by AI is a bad point.
## Zi Ling
1st speaker: You provided a strong, structured opening that laid out your case against AI in education. Good summary

2nd speaker: In future rebuttals, try to spend more time weighing your impacts against theirs. While you addressed their points, you could further solidify your position by explaining why your team’s benefits—like improving educational access
## Yinyin Zhao
1st speaker: there are many arguments provided by con team but each one requires more reasoning/ evidence and impact analysis. for the summary speech, please have more conclusion of your speech, highlight the key points of your team instead of introducing general ideas. 

2nd speaker: in rebuttal speech, try to have more rebuttals instead of giving contentions. You used only 0.5 min in responsing.
# Final decision
## Zaiqi Zhang: Pro
Some of the arguments raised by the con side has some serious topicality issues. Those points are the problems of AI in general. However, the con side failed to set up sufficient link showing how these harms apply to the use of Gen-AI in education. This is a pro ballot because the pro side successfully demonstrated how the use of AI could benefit the realm of education and has more standing impact at the end of the day.
## Zi Ling: Pro
Pro did a better job by showing huge economic benefits of 10 trillion GPD, and 2% of increase in global GDP, Pro also illustrate quantitative data of 256 million of studets would enjoy higher quality of educational resources by AI. In addition, Pro successfully porved AI eliminate bias, for treating students equally no matter races, gender because there's no human influence. Overall, Pro provided substaintial evidence and well-structed analynize with great logic and impact.
## Yinyin Zhao: Pro
there are several clashes in this round. 1. reducing teachers’ shortage. 2. plagarism. 3. misinformation. pro wins the first argument by providing specifc evidence and impact. for the second and third clashes, no team gives grounded analysis/evidence for the two and I dropped them.

# ChatGPT summary
The debate on whether the benefits of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education outweigh the harms was ultimately decided in favor of the Pro team across all three judges' ballots. Here's a summary of the key points:

### **Pro Team (Avenues OL PY)**
- **Argument Structure and Delivery**: Both speakers from the Pro side delivered well-structured arguments. They presented the case that AI in education offers substantial benefits, such as personalized learning, greater access to educational resources, and improved learning processes. The Pro team also emphasized the economic impact of AI, citing data like a potential $10 trillion GDP boost and a 2% increase in global GDP due to AI in education.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **Personalized Learning**: AI can tailor learning experiences to individual student needs, helping them learn at their own pace and improving educational outcomes.
  - **Economic Benefits**: Citing data, the Pro team argued that AI could greatly improve education systems, benefiting 256 million students by providing higher-quality educational resources, especially in underdeveloped areas.
  - **Equality**: AI reduces bias in education by eliminating human prejudices related to race, gender, or socioeconomic status, leading to fairer learning experiences for all students.
  - **Privacy Defense**: The Pro side also addressed privacy concerns raised by the Con team, countering that parental consent mechanisms can mitigate these risks.

### **Con Team (SZ S&T Town FW)**
- **Argument Structure and Delivery**: The Con side argued against AI in education, focusing on potential harms such as plagiarism, misinformation, and the risk of teachers being replaced by AI systems. However, their arguments lacked detailed linkages to the specific context of AI in education, and they struggled to provide adequate evidence for some of their claims.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **Plagiarism and Misinformation**: The Con team raised concerns that AI could increase instances of plagiarism and spread misinformation in educational settings. However, they were unable to provide substantial evidence to support these claims.
  - **Teacher Replacement**: The Con team argued that AI could lead to a decline in teaching jobs. However, this point was considered weak by the judges, as it lacked a direct connection to the debate’s focus on the use of AI as a tool for enhancing education rather than replacing teachers.

### **Key Clash Areas**:
1. **Teacher Shortage**: The Pro side won this clash by showing that AI could alleviate the global shortage of teachers by augmenting their capabilities and supporting students where teachers are unavailable or overwhelmed.
   
2. **Plagiarism and Misinformation**: Both teams mentioned these issues, but neither provided strong evidence or analysis. As a result, the judges found that these points did not weigh heavily in the final decision.
   
3. **Bias**: The Pro team effectively argued that AI can reduce bias in education, treating all students equally and objectively, which resonated more with the judges than the Con team’s concerns.

### **Judges' Rationale**:
- **Zaiqi Zhang**: Pro won because the Con team’s arguments on plagiarism and other general AI issues lacked a direct connection to the specific use of generative AI in education.
- **Zi Ling**: The Pro team’s detailed evidence on economic benefits and their argument that AI reduces human biases in education were convincing.
- **Yinyin Zhao**: The Pro team provided specific evidence and impact regarding teacher shortages, while other arguments, like plagiarism, were dropped due to lack of evidence from both sides.

### **Final Decision: Pro**
Pro won the debate across all three judges, largely due to their well-supported evidence on the benefits of AI in education and the inability of the Con team to effectively link the harms they raised specifically to generative AI in the educational context.
