# Debate 1  

## Pro  
First speaker:  
Clear case giving sufficient evidence and logic. Excellent crossfire skill in giving response and questioning. Good summary speech of asserting accurancy and soild data. Excellent evidence-check.   
  
Second speaker:  
Good structure of rebuttal. Each response to the opposition is effective. Good extension of accurancy.  Good performance in grand crossfire.   
  

## Con  
First speaker:  
Confident speech. Well-organized arguments and logic. Good job! Adding more evidence and directive weighing in summary.  
  
Second speaker:  
Good structure of rebuttal. Trying to give sufficient evidence to support your side points. Good explaination of poverty and availbility. Using evidence or data to quantifiable impact.   

## Final decision  
This round is very close, all of the teams are really good.   
Above pro side gives better extension and impact weighting  
I vote for the pro side.  
1. Con side lack sufficient data and quantifible evidence. Pro side gives better explaination of accurancy. The two layer impact to teachers and students.   
2. The later extension and soildation of con side is not effective enough. The argument in summary like social value and career, no direct weighing in each clashes. Pro side successfully extend their points and framework. So I vote for Pro.  
  
# Debate 2  

## Pro  
1st speaker: signpost your speech better so that I know where each contention is.   
  
2nd speaker: Only providing future solutions is insufficient. Give more offensive blocks in rebuttal.  
  
See more comments below.  

## Con  
1st speaker: good delivery.  
  
2nd speaker: good rebuttal and answering crossfire questions. But do try to make crossfires less messy.  
  
See more comments below.  

## Final decision  
Clashes:  
1. learning outcomes. Tie. Not really an important clash in this debate, dropped after rebuttals. Both sides told me valid data but did not weigh them or tell me which one I should believe.  
2. privacy and cyberattacks. Con. Con successfully persuaded me that cyberattacks will not be eliminated on technology improvement by relevant stats. Although I do believe privacy lost and cyberattacks are two different things in the context of genAI (one is voluntarily giving info and the platform exploited it; the other is attacks from hackers), they were debated as one in this debate.  
3. misinformation and biases. Con. This was a messy clash. A lot of statements were not elaborated so I really hesitated if I should flow them. Generally, con had wider scope (AI affects every users), and pro had larger magnitude (humans are more biased than AI), but pro's response of reducing bias in the future seems a bit weak, as they did not properly explain how this might be achieved. I believe more can be said about it instead of just technology boost.  
4. teacher shortage. Tie. Dropped after summary.   
  
In all, a con ballot.  
  
# Debate 3  

## Pro  
The responses can be less defensive . Dont just focus on the woring  evidence like how cheating is not really happen in real life but just a statistic but pointed out how this is unmechanized or less impactful.  

## Con  
The imapct should be more tangible rather than landing upon some abstrat statistic and concept like rate of cheating and devaluation of education. The Responses is too mitigative by challenging the accessibility and accuracy of the information especially when pro was able to justifed this in constructive. Try to elaborate how specifically it exacerbate inequality in mechanism which enable you to flip your opponents' cases with more specific and more vulnerable stakeholders.  

## Final decision  
It's a pro ballot debate   
On Teachers   
Pro was able to prove how Gen AI is going to solve a pervailing teachers' dissatification towards jobs and brings better productivity. Con responded by saying how this potentially increase the burden since they need to check on students usage on GAI, Which can only be contextualized under the premise that the information is invalid and harmful.However,Pro was able to prove how the current GAI technology has been able to incorporate the function website searching and fact check in frontlining . and the income impact stands in the end.  
On Students performance   
Pro told us how GAI helps students perform better and fit into future employment market. Con argues that this causes plagarism and cheating.In the end, I do think pro's impact was more tangible since overall the outcome is essential and CON wasn't able to quantified the tangible harm of increased chances of cheating and plagarism.Thus pro was able to win on this clash.  
  
   
  
# Debate 4  

## Pro  
clear constructive speech containing clear and well-analysed contentions, good rebuttal and response, clear weighing of impact and framework.  
good engagement. Solid rebuttal against con side with good logic and factual analysis.   
Suggestion: as for the inequality issue, try to engage with your opponent when they argues that as ai are just assistants, poor students are still inaccessible because many of them have limited access to schools and teachers, try to pove how such situation can be solved in real life instead of just giving a logical link.  

## Con  
Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence. The impact analysis andSuggestion: weighing on the whole case is pretty well.  
Good logic analysis and quick response to your opponents, try to add more factual response with concrete evidence.   

## Final decision  
This is a con ballot. This debate is very close, both two teams are pretty good. Two main clashes in this round.  
The first clash is plagiarism and over reliance.   
The Pro side argues that 1) right now survey indicates that only 25% student turn to GenAI for help. 2) even if plagiarism and over reliance is true, teachers can change the structure to avoid GenAI from being used  
Con side gave strong response to this point 1) 25% already indicates that it's a serious issue 2) checking plagiarism will only add more burden to teachers, Also pro lack specific analysis to prove how it can be effectively avoided.  
3) over reliance on GenAI will damage critical thinking and many other soft skills, which is crucial for students future development and finding jobs.   
The second clash is about equality.   
Pro argues that GenAI can enable poor students get more accessible to education while con side put forward many concern that remains unsolved: as GenAI are just assistants, poor students are still inaccessible because many of them have limited access to schools and teachers. Pro failed to pove how such situation can be solved in real life.  
  
# Debate 5  

## Pro  
Good to hear the usage of AI could better help students find their own strength and reduce the cost of education. On top of that, AI could cushion teachers’ huge workload. Good to provide law protection.  

## Con  
It’s good to hear AI use may lead to exposure of privacy and financial loss. Wonderful to hear the low accessibility of students from poor families.  

## Final decision  
  
This is a Con SH GAS ZH ballot.  
  
First of all, i would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!  
  
Clash 1-Accessibility  
Comparatively, Con does a better job in engagement by pointing out the vulnerable group—poor families, accompanied with the analysis that it may affect the excellent function of AI. Also, although some points in Pro side are quite good, those are lack of enough material behind. It will be better if Pro could have more evidence to support their contentions and less reliance on their own script.  
  
# Debate 6  

## Pro  
First speaker:  
Clear structure of case. Sufficient data and strong logic to prove the advantages of AI. Good extension of inequality. Try to give more organized summary structure like the impact weighing in each clash.   
  
Second speaker:  
Good rebuttal. Amount of evidence and logic to against the stance and economic issue. Take care of the time-management. Good job! Excellent final focus, giving voting points: productivity and inequality.   

## Con  
First speaker:  
Well-organized case structure. Clear logic and impact. Excellent skill of asking questions and giving response during cf. Excellent summary, giving strong emphasis of more people. Good job!  
  
  
Second speaker:  
Clear rebuttal. Try to add more directive evidence to support the stances. Logic is good. Good response in cf. Giving more effective voting points in final focus.   
  

## Final decision  
Both of the teams are really good, this round is very close.   
For the pro side has better extension and complete framework. I vote for pro.  
1. Pro side gives reasonable voting points: productivity and equality. Sufficient comparsion between replacing. Con side should improve the directive comparsion and follow-up response.  
2. Pro side impact is correlated with their evidence. Although con impact to each citizen, pro side challgencing the unrealistic issue there. Con should explain how shrink will happen in economic system and related data to extend your points.    
Both teams are really good.   
  
  
# Debate 7  

## Pro  
1st speaker: speak slower. I doubt if asking opponents about one piece of evidence over and over again in crossfire is good strategy. I understand you're trying to attack the validity and scope of that, but to me chatgpt is quite representative of genAI because of the No. of users. So you just allowed your opponents to repeat their card multiple times.  
  
2nd speaker: good rebuttal structure, but your evidence on genAI provides reliable information sounds like ads instead of valid card. Good pushing in crossfire pointing out opps do not have direct evi for plagiarism.  
  
Overall: good attacks in crossfire, but a lot of rebuttals sound unconvincing. Instead of using "nonunique" or "cherry-picking" blocks all the time, try attack their logically or impact more offensively.  

## Con  
1st speaker: Prepare questions to ask in crossfire.  
  
2nd speaker: Very good rebuttal! I like how multi-layered repsonses is set.  
  
Overall: very good strategy, but there is room for improvement especially regarding answering crossfire questions. Should be more prepared when opp asked for evidence.  

## Final decision  
A con ballot.  
4 clahses:  
Misinformation: con. Reason already stated above.  
Plagirasim: con. Although pro tried to say cheating is nonunique and can be prevented, con made it clear that the prevention measures against plagiarism already proved the existence of the problem. And it is hard to buy pro's nonunique attack when con clearly stated the logic of genAI plagiarism.  
Student capability: pro. Pro gave more evidence, but con did not provide direct evidence, as correctly pointed out by pro.  
Inaccessibility: tie. Pro is well-prepated in this contention, but con wisely gave the evidence on lack of internet usage. Plus it is quite risky to claim that gen AI can replace all teachers (As pro said in summary). So con turned this harm down into a tie.  
  
So a con ballot.  
  
# Debate 8  

## Pro  
1: clear constructive speech containing clear and well-analysed contentions, good rebuttal and response, clear weighing of impact and framework  
Suggestion: environment argument is not related to this education topic, you can focus more on students and teachers.  
  
2: good engagement. Solid rebuttal against con side to prove the benefits of GenAI concerning inequality and efficiency.   
Suggestion: try to mitigate the economy argument on con side. You can try to argue 1) teachers are still unique, GenAI just function as assistants, thus teachers are irreplaceable 2) GenAI will not replace teachers in a very short time, i.e such issue can be solve by retraining, the government will not sit watching  

## Con  
1: Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence.   
suggestion:Do not easily agree with your opponent!  
Try to put forward more questions about your opponent's case.  
Try Include more stakeholder, your whole case focus only on teachers while students are also core stakeholders in this topic.  
  
2: You did a good job giving rebuttals to your opponents by giving layers of logic and factual responses.   
suggestion: Don't just talk the best case scenario on your side, try to have more engagement.  

## Final decision  
This is a pro ballot. Two main clashes in this round.  
The first clash is decreasing inequality. Pro provide solid evidence to prove that GenAI can help decrease poverty and help disabled group because AI tutoring is much cheaper and accessible. This enables vulnerable groups have higher salary and then increase social mobility. Con side questions the real life impact but failed to give effective rebuttal. Also Con side somehow do agrees that GenAI helps raise grades and are effective in helping students, thus Pro side wins this clash.  
The second clash is whether teachers will get replaced by GenAI.  
Con has multiple layers of evidence to prove traditional teachers will be replaced by GenAI, accounting for 30 million ppl. This will lead to the chain reaction of rising suicide rate and crime rate. Pro questions 1) teachers will not be replaced because GenAI will function as helpers. 2) poor students without GenAI may also become future criminals, causing many social problems. This effective washed the impact on con side.  
So in the end, Pro wins.  
  
# Debate 9  

## Pro  
1st Speaker: I Strongly suggest u pace down ur speech to avoid slurring your words which makes it more understandable to the judges and opponent.   
  
2nd Speaker: The Rebuttal is too Summative instead of engaging. Try to come up with more other refuting technique other than outweigh which is really dependant on that your contention stands at the end of the debate.  

## Con  
1st Speaker:  
The case itself can be too borad which can really applied to all issue that correalted with unemployment which brings less relevancy. Try to talk about some unique harm of Gen AI Rather than the overall employment shift under technological evolution, especially when your opponent was able to mitigate it on impact and the likelihood.  
  
2nd Speaker   
The overall rebuttal is engaging enough but the linkage itself is quite vague by saying how going to college is expensive which will not be solved on both side. Try to elaborate how GAI exacerbate the inequality and reduce the actual chance for people from lower socio-economic status to be in college.  

## Final decision  
It's a pro ballot debate   
Overall pro was able to mitigate the harm of unemployment and the imapct is a bit far fetch in the end.The impact on providing better education to poor students is valid and manifest greater vulneralbility.  
On Academic Performance   
Pro was able to prove with both logical analysis and empirical evidence that students will have a better academic outcome and thus have better income.Con was able to respond how humans are likely to haveessential impact on students but this is remained quantified.   
On Educational Equality   
Both team consent that GAI is accessible and capable in constructive ( That's why it causes unemployment according to CON) Thus GAI does provide more accessible education to students from lower socio-economic status. But the impact from pro  was challenged by CON saying that not everyone is able to afford college. but in the end the mitigation is remained quantified thus pro's impact still stand. And in the end pro was trying to weigh this by vulneralbility which magnifest the stakeholder suffers the most.  
On Teachers  
a.Unemployment   
Pro's responses was on how Teachers themselves not afraid of being replaced and why institution do not have incentive to do this. This is somehow assertive with only a empirical evidence. CON trying to weigh this against Educational Equality by saying how the magnitude can be tremendous since economic fluctuation caused by unemployment can be tremendous. But in the end the linkage is quite vague given that CON wasn't able to justified how the imapct of economic fluctuation will be serious enough  
b.Productivity   
Pro was able to prove how this save time for teachers. CON wasn't able to direct engage but just outweigh this with unemployment.  
  
# Debate 10  

## Pro  
Good to hear the usage of AI could improve the performance of students based on self judgement and 84.3% accuracy. Wonderful rebuttal on the cheating exists not just because of AI.  

## Con  
It’s good to hear over depence of AI use, further linking to increased cheating. Good to rebut poor students could not access to the wide usage of AI.  

## Final decision  
This is a Pro BJ Keystone SH ballot.  
  
First of all, i would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!  
  
Clash 1-Accessibility  
Both sides have their own discussion on this point. Good for Con to point out potential harm with AI cheating and poor students analysis. Pro does a better job in comparison and analyzing. Pro compares the cost of teachers and AI, also the data catching and further issues. Also, Pro points out problem related with AI cheating  could  be well addressed by students’ self judgement and regulations of schools.  
  
# Debate 11  

## Pro  
speaker1: well structured constructive speech. Good summary with the comparisons on scope, evidence. besides of that, i think impact weighing can be stronger.  
  
speacker 2: strong rebuttal with clear layers. Every rebuttal has evi supported and reasoning.  
FF: good impact weiging and comparisons. well done  

## Con  
speaker1: good constructive speech with strong logic link and evidence. Impact are strong are well stated. Summary is well structured and clear. However, its more like a rebuttal instread of a summary.  
speaker2: good rebuttal, but i think the structure can be clearer. Also i want to hear some rerebuttal on pro’s rebuttal since you still have almost one min.   
i think your side’s impact is not well linked? or there’s not enough explanations between the impact and the FW  

## Final decision  
clash: bias  
pro wins as con failed to rerebuttal and didn’t provid a solid response on pro’s question “ai is more/less bias than teachers”  
clash: teacher shortage   
pro wins as they give out solid evidence, and show the harm/direct negative side of the teacher shortage.  
impacts: pro wins on the overall impacts.  
  
  
  
  
# Debate 12  

## Pro  
1.Pro mentioned teachers are assisted by AI tools positively. The impact are also well-explained (reduce pressure, improve efficiency, education quality; solving teacher shortage problem etc.); importance of the impact could be discussed more;  
2.Pro argued about Studentsê benefits; Studentsê comprehensive skills can be improved by involving AI. (data is presented but the mechanism is not fully elaborated) Data (is only outcome) alone cannot picturize the process: how is this happening? (Impact: earnings; economic benefits)  

## Con  
Framework: benefit students as a whole  
1.Avoid reliance on AI; (mechanism: students find answers easily; why there is no monitoring system?) Data is also included to support. Impact: degradation on decision making abilities (harms based this could be further elaborated; What will happen if students lose critical thinking or reasoning skills?)  
2.Bias issue; (facts of biased information are provided; improper recommendation; gender bias); risks of being continuous bias; Impact: not clear here in construction but supplemented by the second speaker with data.  

## Final decision  
Clash analysis:  
Clash 1: benefits on students or not (better learning result or heavier reliance?);  
Proês mechanism is not enough to reach their strong impact while Conês impact about çover-relianceé is not extended although the mechanism is enough. This clash is somewhat tied.  
Clash 2: Bias problem;  
Con makes this argument in a robust way, but proês deconstruction is not enough to mitigate this point (details explained in engagement evaluation). Con won this clash slightly.  
  
Engagement evaluation:  
Pro to Con:  
A.Students lose thinking abilities: AI actually cultivate critical thinking skills (how? Not so clear.)  
B.Inaccuracy of AI: Surveys show that AI is widely used (it does not equal to accuracy)  
C.Bias issue: the problem can be solved (1. what specific methods? Not so clear. 2. Human teachers also have bias, but this claim lack evidence and analysis. 3. Indeed, you push the other side to prove why AI is more biased than teachers but their tangible impact has been proved, which means your challenge to this point should include the demonstration on why teachers are less biased. 4. Moreover, it is not a question about whether AI or human teachers create bias, con simply just argued why the bias problem become more severe after the application of AI.)  
Con to Pro:  
A.Teacher shortage (three layers of responses):  
Many causes of teacher shortages (low page...etc. Which can be solved)  
AI undermines authorities of teachers and some teachers lose jobs (backlashes)  
B.Rebuild the case about bias issue: teachers are more diversified; different races and genders  
  
Based on the engagement evaluation, Conês rebuttal is comparatively better for their more organized and reasonable analysis. According to the clash analysis, the first one is tied while con won the second. In conclusion, con won this debate.  
  
# Debate 13  

## Pro  
(Paste this entire block to a separate doc to read all the comments as some are hidden due to space limit)   
1st: Overall valid arguments; for the first contention, the McKinsey evidence u mentioned was more on automated technology but not AI in particular. Also ur first impact on this argument, u probably need to explain more about how teacher leaving their positions is a direct consequence of 84% of students not receiving education. For the 2nd contention, the last bit of impact on market value needs further elaboration. For the summary speech, good job to extend on ur response to the biased argument, and when u r extending ur teacher shortage impact, u could explain more on this point how AI could not only reduce the teacher shortage issue but also, with AI, the teacher can foster better learning environment as well.  
2nd: The responses are overall okay. For ur response on “students will use AI despite regulation, so they responded to their points”, u might want to explain a bit more on this to make it clearer but ur response to the 2nd contention is generally valid. For the final focus, good job falling back on ur own impact but u could also do more impact-weighing (e.g. why at least having an education is better than receiving a biased education to the best con scenario)  

## Con  
(Paste this entire block to a separate doc to read all the comments as some are hidden due to space limit)   
1st: Overall, it sounded to me like the impacts of ur two arguments are a bit disconnected: the 1st more on students’ learning outcomes and the 2nd on loss in revenue. I believe u could elaborate more on the impact of ur 2nd contention to attach it to students’ learning outcomes (like give me more tangible or quantifiable impacts on how bias affects education). In ur 2nd contention, u might want to add a piece of evidence of how bias in AI will result in bias in students. Also, it might be beneficial to include a clearer framework in this case to connect ur points, but overall the arguments are valid. For the summary speech. while it’s a good approach to extend ur first contention, try to explain why opponents’ rebuttals is false instead of just restating ur own evidence. U made several new points in the summary speech (which could have been better to bring in earlier in the debate), and they generally lacked evidence when u mentioned in the summary speech.  
2nd: I don’t hear a straightforward response to answer their 2nd contention on the learning environment. If u think the two arguments were talking about similar issues, do explain how it is so before responding to it as a whole. Meanwhile, I like ur response to the 1st contention but it would be more beneficial to include more evidence to strengthen ur response. For the final focus, u could focus slightly more on ur first contention with more tangible impacts and do more impact-weighing in ur speech.  

## Final decision  
I vote for the PRO side.  
The pro side managed to extend the benefits of AI in teacher issues throughout the debate. While the con side attempted to respond to this, it sounded to me that there was an aspect of students benefiting from teachers having more time with the help of AI to help students that were not directly addressed by the con side. (They later brought in wage issues in the grand crossfire and somehow conceeded in falling back to the bias arguments when opponents restated their earlier cards.) Yet, still, the bias argument was well responded to by the pro side, and its significance is limited.  
  
# Debate 14  

## Pro  
Good job in asking for cards to help to verify evidence to try and exploit weaknesses in the opponents arguments. Additional in the rebuttal stating the points the con side failed to counter effectively. And was intense in reiterating the points that the opponents failed to contend to properly. Good debate  

## Con  
Made some contradicting statements to their con side which the pro side pointed out during the debate. This is as it regards to the point where they stated that 70% of students will choose to keep using ai. Also struggled to answer some questions in the crossfire and wasnt able to strengthen your stance on some clash points such as teacher shortage, how are teachers devalued, and how for example.  

## Final decision  
Teacher shortage  
PRO: Teacher are leaving the professional because of workload. 55000 vacant teacher position is the us. 44 million teachers are need worldwide by 2030. Ai integrate can help teachers, 20-30 of teaching hours could be automated that would reduce work load by 13 hours which could be used to benefit the students. Reducing the workload is the best way to keep teachers from quitting their jobs. Ai tools have already saved 10 million hours world wide.  
  
Con said there are many things that affect teacher shortage. 94% of teachers  spend there own pay to supply class resources. Will undermine teachers , cause teachers to be valued less and it will make a lot of jobs easier which will enhance the teacher shortage. Low pay, lack of support. Said pro is making the teacher problem worse causing less stress less work so now there will be less teachers since there is less need for teachers.  
  
Pro stated Uk parliament 92% cited workload as a reason why teachers are quit. Pro wins the point.  
  
  
  
Education outcome- Better quality education  
  
Pro: Create effective learning environment, developing critical skills, reduces time wastage and helps students to pass exams at higher rates. 43% of students in us use ai to help improve their test results by over 50% and performance of 20%.  
  
Con: - expect to find information quickly without any effort. Increase in plagiarism increase from 40 to over 60%. Teachers are worried about how ai will change the way students work. Overreliance of ai, 75% of students said they would still continue to use them. Students tend to score lower by 15% when ai is used. Excessive use of ai can lead to reducing critical thinking skills and logical ability.   
  
Con asked if pro doesn’t think it will decrease the teachers value in society, pro said it wont , pro said it is designed to help teachers to provide a high quality of education, so many students do not have a teacher and ai can be a substitute students can get a higher quality of education and the con does not prove how ai will devalue the teacher.  
  
  
Additionally Pro said how con stated how people are lazy and overreliant, but how is this a problem for ai, it is not unique. Con stated they will provide this information later but they didn’t go into further detail about this. Pro wins the point  
  
Pro said ai boosts critical thinking and encourage students to improve problem solving skills. Plagiarism with ai, pro said that in their own card stated 70% of students will choose to keep using ai so they are contradicting their con side. And on their side it shows that ai imporove scores by over 50%.   
  
  
Bias  
Con stated ai is bias and people will believe that anything chatgpt says is true.  
Cause more discrimination and gender inequality costing 100 of trillions of dollars. Pro asked how many people were affected by this, con stated they don’t have the number of the people that were affected by they show the economic cost which is important.  Pro asked how much more bias is ai when compared to teachers, Con struggled to reply to this question.  
  
 Con stated if chatgpt is initially bias so if students are using from a young age then they will develop these bias’ into adulthood.  
Pro stated they failed to identify how this racial inequality is a direct relation to ai. Only if they prove ai is more bias than teachers but they cannot prove that. Pro wins the point  
  
  
  
Pro said cons stated that whichever side benefits students more should win, con said the pro side is not solving it either, implying that they are not solving the issue. Pro stated Ai tools have already saved 10 million hours world wide. And they asked cons since ai is widely adopted now isthere is a drop in the teaching salary ? and if so how are the teachers devalued which they had difficulty to reply to.  
Pro wins  
  
  
# Debate 15  

## Pro  
Well structured cases and Really good frontlining.  
  
  

## Con  
  
1)Try to have better denfisive response and extended on card , how the worry   
  
2)Try to analyzing how the mechanism GenAI itself exacerbate the inequality on more related stakeholders who also exeperiencing economic sparities ( but not only for those who cannot afford Gen AI ) Membership   

## Final decision  
It's a pro ballot debate   
On Employment   
Pro told us how Gen AI help teacher reallocate time and resouces and solve teachers shortage by reducing workload prevent them from leaving. Con claim that teacher leave their position because AI and also confess that this can reduce workload but in longrun they will lose their job and potentially commit suicide or drug abuse. 1)The evidence is not actually addressing the causation like Pro responsded , it's only and opinion and worry  rather than something really happen .and The likelihood from Con extented from unemployment  is quite low  and far-fetch thus this clash goes to Pro.  
  
On Quality of Education   
Pro argues Gen AI is going to bring better test result for students by prevent them from failing whereas CON argues the opposite and they all have empirical evidence on impact. The final voting was decided on the scope of the evidence impact. Pro's cards was on test genrally wheras Con's merely land upon one single AI Model  (WHich is simple version ) thus vote Goes to Pro .  
  
Misinformation   
How the harm of  racism itself being exerted on human is vague, and pro was able to respond 1)how those information also comes from existing materials made by human.2)How fixing bias is way more easier in AI model than millions of individual 3)Average individuals are more likely to biased   
  
  
  
On Accessibility   
PRo was able to respond how the resource inequality is not caused by AI itself and those stakeholders

## Pro  
All the individual comment is included in the RFD below.  
  

## Con  
All the individual comment is included in the RFD below.  
  

## Final decision  
Here’s the reason why I’m voting for the PRO side:  
1.     Framework  
PRO: N/A  
CON: N/A  
   
2.     Clashes  
(1)   Student  
PRO believes that AI can help students learn well, including improving efficiency by 20%, allowing 98% of students to avoid failing courses, improving test scores by 62%, and reducing anxiety by 20%. CON believes that students will use and rely on AI in large quantities, resulting in a reduction in their critical thinking ability and a 17% decline in learning outcomes. On this point, both sides have sufficient data to prove their own views. However, both sides are basically talking to themselves, without providing any effective weighing or impact comparison. Thus, tie on this point.  
   
(2)   Teacher  
CON believes that AI will replace a large number of teachers, resulting in a large number of teachers being unemployed. Although CON cannot provide data to prove how many teachers will be unemployed, they have produced evidence to prove that AI will lead to a 50%-70% reduction in teachers' salaries. But in contrast, PRO believes that AI can greatly improve teachers' work efficiency and reduce working hours by 20%-30%. On this point, although both sides still have a lot of data, they also lack direct attacks or reasonable comparisons. Tie on this point.  
   
(3)   Bias  
CON believes that AI contains a lot of discriminatory information, such as unequal racial information. CON mentioned that 80% of black students have been harmed by racial discrimination, and AI will exacerbate this phenomenon. But PRO accurately mentioned that the harm to these 80% of black students was not caused by AI, and CON did not mention the impact that was unique to AI. In addition, PRO also mentioned that these biases themselves are actually human factors and have nothing to do with AI technology. CON did not follow up more. Thus pro wins this point.  
   
(4)   False Information  
CON believes that AI contains a lot of wrong information, for example, 80% of the answers produced by AI contain wrong and misleading information. But PRO successfully mentioned that CON only mentioned the error rate of AI, but did not compare it with human teachers, so it is impossible to conclude that AI is worse than human teachers. Thus, pro wins this point.  
   
(5)   Environment  
CON believes that the use of AI will cause great harm to the environment, although I did not catch the data used by CON. But PRO did not respond to this point. But CON only spent less than 1 second in their summary to address this point, because I do not accept CON's victory on this point. Tie on this point.  
   
(6)   Digital Divide  
CON believes that there are 2.6 billion people in the world who have no internet access, which makes it impossible for these people to use AI. PRO first asked CON how many of these 2.6 billion people can go to school without internet access. But because PRO himself did not provide evidence to prove that the 2.6 billion people have enough access to educational resources, I do not accept PRO's way of asking questions. But PRO also said that the digital divide itself is off-topic in this debate, because the debate only discusses the use of AI in education, and people who cannot access AI are not within the scope of this debate. Although there are some problems with this logic, CON has not successfully addressed the problem of global inequality brought about by the digital divide, so I still accept PRO's rebuttal. Thus pro wins this point.  
  
  
# Debate 17  

## Pro  
Good to hear the teachers’ shortage and students’ imrpovement on academic performance and critical thinking. Good to rebut the data should not only base on GPT but should include more. Good to point out bias is not sole on AI but teachers included.  

## Con  
It’s good to hear over dependence on AI may lead to misinformation for students and deepen AI’s bias on colored people.   

## Final decision  
This is a Pro SH GAS ZH ballot.  
  
First of all, i would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!  
  
Clash 1-Flexibility  
Pro does a better job in building their logic chain with firm evidence. In both crossfire and rebuttal speech, Pro pointed that A. data 17%  from Con is solely based on GPT but not all Gen AI B. the bias given by Con could not be simply diminished by banning the use of AI. Those engagement are quite effective.  It would better if Con could provide more related data and better logic in their speech, also. more engagement in Con being expected.  
  
# Debate 18  

## Pro  
Peiling: Your constructive was so smooth and clear. Everything was articulated and easy to follow. Excellent job! You asked such brilliant questions in crossfire.  
  
Qingwei: Great rebuttal speech! I love how much logical sense you have in each of your response. I am amazed you were able to organize it within such a small amount of time.  

## Con  
Yizhou: You a have lot of energy and passion! Sometimes, it’d be more effecient to delivery speeches if you could slow down a little.  
  
Ziqi: You had so many impacts concerning the world’s economy and health. I am not hearing the links between these to how these affect one weighing the benefits or harms about using AI in education.  

## Final decision  
This resolution addresses the use of AI in education; both teams misunderstood each other on several major arguments. Since the rebuttal, the discussion has veered off-topic, with the primary debate focusing on AI's resource consumption compared to other search engines. I agree with the PRO side that this doesn’t directly relate to assessing AI's educational benefits or drawbacks. Regardless of how teachers adapt to AI, the cost and resources for AI training will not be circumvented.  
  
# Debate 19  

## Pro  
speaker 1: Good delivery.  
  
speaker 2: Rebuttal can be more clearly structured.   

## Con  
speaker 1: No rush at the start of your constructive... Good crossfire skills. Good clash nubmering in summary, although I do think there are more clashes than the 3 you named.  
  
speaker 2: Good multi-layered responses in rebuttal.   

## Final decision  
1. teacher shortage and unemployment: Con clash. I am persuaded that Pro has self-contradcition in this clash. They did not properly explain how genAI can be TA and teacher at the same time (I understand pro is trying to establish a teaching quality hierarchy of: good teachers > GPT > bad teachers, but if GPT already could provide satisfying teaching, schools would have the incentive to fire good teachers too). So either way con has an advantage here.  
2. environment and inaccuracy: I put these two clahses together because pro provided similar reponse: nonunique. It is hard to assign these to any side because I personally do buy the nonunique response, but it is not offenstive enough to turn the argument.  
3. data leakage: Con clash. Pro dropped this point, and con brought it up again in ff.  
4. inequality: Neither team explained the logic clearly enough to win this clash.  
5. future opportunities: Pro clash. Con's response to this point was weak, but pro could have made larger use of this argument in this debate.  
So a con ballot.  
  
# Debate 20  

## Pro  
 clear constructive speech containing clear and well-analysed contentions, good rebuttal and response, clear weighing of impact and framework  
Suggestion:   
Good logic analysis and quick response to your opponents, try to add more factual response with concrete evidence.  

## Con  
Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence. The impact analysis andSuggestion:  
The climate change point is very powerful but it not closely related to this education topic. Try to focus more on the main stakeholders and main issues related to this topic.  

## Final decision  
This is a pro ballot. This debate is very close, both two teams are pretty good. Two main clashes in this round.  
The first clash is biases and over reliance.    
 Pro points out that with increasiingly growing data base and more diversified information included, GenAI can be more accurate and can actually help students think more critically. Also, Con argues that reliance on GenAI may lead to mass unemployment of teachers, pro point out that 1)the cost of laying off teachers is too big 2) teachers have their own uniqueness, GenAI functions as assistants helping reduce teachers's stress and improve their working efficiency.  
The second clash is accessibility.  
con side argues that poor students in developing countries have limited access to the basic Internet, schools and teachers. Even worse, GenAI will further worsen such gap because of the digital resources gap. Pro side argues that on con side such inequality issue won't be changed and remains a social problem, while comparatively on the pro side, with the fast growing trend of autonomy and digital development,  Gen AI can help provide basic education to poor students.

SH Starriver WL win since their opponent has forfeited  
  
# Debate 22  

## Pro  
The case of boosting critical thinking, cultivating abilities are well-established and supported by abundant data. However, the impact could be elaborated in a more in-depth way. Pro also highlighted personalized learning, which could have been analyzed deeper as a case to rebut the over-reliance problem mentioned by con. Pro is suggested to give more reasons to emphasize the uniqueness of AI. Although there have been much benefits in AI-assisted learning, why these benefits are irreplaceable and decisive in students' learning process.  

## Con  
The case of bias problem is argued in a skillful way. More comparisons should be done to highlight why this issue outweighs proês benefits. Con mentioned mental health, social relationship and many other important fields, trying to argue AI can not help with these fields(AIês limitations). However, the cultivation of these soft skills could be symmetric on both sides. Pro just said AI is another assistance. Con needs to pay attention to this point.  

## Final decision  
Clash 1: whether AI leads to positive study mode  
Con rebutted the case by emphasizing the over-reliance (a good strategy but lack mechanism, however, it weakens proês argument about positive study since pro did not have clear response to this rebuttal; all in all it is still proês best case scenario; therefore, this clash is tied.)  
Clash 2: bias issue in AI usage; whether bias is caused by AI (Con did factual contextualization to argue why the bias is more likely to be caused by AI. There is no much direct and effective response heard from pro to this point. Although pro did provide solutions but their solution in constructive speech is not targeted on this bias issue. Con also argued the bias is mainly aggregated by AI since its application make the bias root in peopleês mind.) Con won this clash.(no surprise since it is conês best case scenario)  
In summary, two main clashes in total, one is tied while con won another, and therefore con won this debate.  
  
# Debate 23  

## Pro  
clear constructive speech containing clear and well-analysed contentions, good rebuttal and response  
  
Suggestion: lack engagement, Try to be less aggressive and the crossfire parts only in this way can you hear clearly about what your opponents are talking about and then gave solid response to them.   
You need to aware that even if general AI is a tool, if many students can not use it correctly, then it's harmful. Is your burden to prove why it will not be misused.   

## Con  
Overall you have a really good performance. youêve done a pretty good constructive speech with clear arguments and strong evidence. The impact analysis andSuggestion: weighing on the whole case is pretty well.  
Suggestion:  
Good logic analysis and quick response to your opponents, try to add more factual response with concrete evidence.   
  

## Final decision  
This is a con ballot. This debate is very close, both two teams are pretty good. Two main clashes in this round.  
The first clash is cheating and over reliance. Pro side gave solution to cheating by arguing that right now already exists technology to detect plagiarism. However, the con's point of over reliance leads to lack of emotional support and social skills which are crucial for students future development.   
The second clash is about equality.   
Pro argues that GenAI can enable poor students get more personalied and effective education while con side put forward many concern that remains unsolved: poor students in developing countries are still inaccessible to the Gen AI because many of them have limited access to schools and teachers. Even worse, GenAI will further worsen such issue because of the resources gap. Pro failed to pove how such situation can be solved in real life.  
  
# Debate 24  

## Pro  
Good to hear the usage of AI could enhance students’ critical thinkings and overall performance, accompanied with clear regulations as a backup.  

## Con  
It’s good to hear AI use may lead to cheating potential and educational inequality. Over reliance may lead to dimished teachers’ role, further making students be lack of necessary social skills.  

## Final decision  
This is a Con HZ BASIS ZP ballot.  
  
First of all, i would like to say congratulations to both teams. You all did an amazing job finishing this excellent debate!  
  
Clash 1-Accessibility  
Both sides have their own discussion on this point. Comparatively, Con does a better in proving and analyzing with more important stakeholders. The combination of less functional of teachers’ role, students’ lack of social skills and poor countries not covered with advanced technology is quite clear for Con side to draw the picture of their case. Also, the comparison over a world with/without wide use of AI in education is well connected with their picture. It would be better if Pro could engage more and provide a better logic chain with exact data.

speaker2: good rebuttal with evidence provided, impacted listed, (but mismatch in rebuttal 2). well done FF: strong world comparison and impact weighings. However, i would like to hear more about how your side is benefiting the students.  

## Final decision  
clash: cheating/over rely  
clash: inequality on education/race  
pro mentioned ‘reduce education gap’ while con mentioned AI will larger the education gap, but both team didn’t give a strong response on this. not taking in consider  
pro wins where con didn’t provide enough follow up on the rebuttal  
clash: personalized learning  
pro wins as the mentioned not all teachers are being replaced and AI are only used as a tool  
  
  
# Debate 27  

## Pro  
(Paste this entire block to a separate doc to read all the comments as some are hidden due to space limit)   
1st: Although u mentioned ur only contention is education, this contention is too general, and I heard quite a few points in ur speech that could be made as individual contentions. Meanwhile, u said GPT is accessible for only $25 per month, but even this might be expensive for people in developing countries. Also ur last point on self-directed learning, I don’t see the connection between crimes, dropouts, and education and how AI could reduce crimes through self-directed learning. U might need more evidence to connect the link. For the summary speech, make sure to tie back to ur own arguments and extend the impact. Meanwhile, although ur partner frontlined opponents’ responses, it would still be beneficial to extend some of the impacts in ur speech.  
2nd: Structurally, the rebuttal is okay but could be benefitted by referring to specific lines mentioned by ur opponents for more targeted attacks. U mentioned Hong Kong University offering GPT to students, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that it is entirely beneficial - it could serve as generalized evidence to show that the benefit of AI in education outweighs the harm, but in debate, u need to give more specified reasoning to explain each of ur point. For the final focus, you did a good job pointing out the contradiction and logical fallacies, but these could have come out earlier in the summary and try to give me more impact weighing in the last speech.  

## Con  
(Paste this entire block to a separate doc to read all the comments as some are hidden due to space limit)   
1st: Overall, it sounded to me that ur arguments had evidence but lacked logical reasoning to explain them. U mentioned how there is worse performance or cheating (with evidence) when we use AI but why is it so and what is the impact exactly, make sure to elaborate more on it. For the summary speech, make sure to defend opponents’ rebuttals of ur arguments more directly, and avoid making generalized statements (e.g. students use AI and they can get answers directly, make sure to back them up with evidence)  
2nd: Ur rebuttal speech could benefit more from including evidence. For ur response to personalized learning, make sure to explain more thoroughly why inequality in education makes this point problematic. Also, I didn’t hear a direct response to their last argument on helping self-directed learning. For the final focus, note the contradiction: if u say that AI creates greater inequality, aren’t u acknowledging the positive outcomes of AI in education for inequality to exist? Also, try to tie back more to ur own arguments to convince me they outweigh over opponents’ arguments.   
  

## Final decision  
I vote for the PRO side  
Both teams need to work on elaborating their logic and direct engagement throughout the debate. However, I ended up voting for the pro side because their argument on AI is not replacing teachers but making teachers teach students better, thus bringing down the big part of the con’s rebuttal. Meanwhile, there isn’t sufficient effective follow-up from the con side to counter pro rebuttals.  
  
  
# Debate 28  

## Pro  
on the clash point of cost effectiveness cons stated that ai is more expensive when u add the electricity cost, wifi cost, etc , Please note that if you could give a price point comparison to prove that its cheaper on your part then it would prove your impact is greater.   
  
Con Said ai cant solve the problem with education inequality because its rich person that will have access to using ai tools and will gain advantage from them but at this point it would but they did not prove  how not using ai would help with the inequality, it would have been good to bring this to the attention of the judges.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

## Con  
As it regards to the bias clash point on bias and misinformation when Pro stated that Ai can stop and detect misinformation by 92%. Humans can be bias and 30% of bias has caused misdiagnosing of patients so this proves that humans can be more bias than ai.  
If Con  you can outweigh their impact by citing statistiscal data of how ai can be more bias then that would help to strengthen your claim on this clash point.  
  
Con Said ai cant solve the problem with education inequality because its rich person that will have access to using ai tools and will gain advantage from them but cons also did not prove how not using ai would help with the inequality  
  
  

## Final decision  
Con: Students performed worse in using ai  and can inhibit learning, unwilling to spend effort to do work. Rise in Cheating , negative impact on academic integrity. 47% of students says its easier to cheat.  
  
Pro expected to save universities over 19 million dollars. Help to solve the teacher shortage. Can help to close the gap providing a low cost high quality education. Improve teacher productivity and reduce administrating workload and faculty productivity by over 30% and help to complete tasks 25% faster. Help students to improve their education experience, cause 60% improvement in student scores. 140 million students drop out from school each year and a large percentage of crime is caused by the dropouts. Ai can help to provide education for these people  
  
  
Cost effectiveness  
Con said does every student have access to ai. Pro said ai is cheap to afford especially when compared to teacher. Con said when u compare electricity, wifi, computer cost, ai will still be costly and this is the problem many developing countries are facing.  
Pro said it is still cheaper that the labour cost that you would have to pay a teacher because ai is just a few dollars a month  
For Pro It would have been better to do a price point comparison so that we can know if you outweigh their impact.  
  
Teacher shortage  
Con- reliance on ai can diminish the role of teachers, influences the teachers leadership roles.  Education is about shaping student character, personality, and teacher mentorship and emotional support. Access to ai will affect education outcome and cause people to perform worse. Pro said AI can boost the efficient of teachers and ai will be used in conjunction with teachers and not to replace teachers but to help them be more productive and then students will still have the benefit that the cons stated for the teacher to provide emotional support and mentorship to students. More students will be able to get taught  
Pro said ai will not replace teachers, it is just a tool that is used to reduce workload and to help the students.  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Plagarism and Cheating   
  
Con said ai is harming education and promotes cheating. Pro said students will cheat either way and its not the problem for ai. Generative ai will make it very easier for students to cheat, without ai, it is very time consuming and difficult to cheat  
   
  
Pro said ai can improve the process of active learning and universities are offering chatgpt so this proves that even university knows how beneficial ai for students and to boost learning efficiency. As it regards to cheating, school has already put measure in places to punish students that plagiarism and that abuse ai tool. And even if ai is elimated completely  students can use the internet to do plagiarism works  
  
  
BIAS  
Pro stated that Ai can stop and detect misinformation by 92%. Humans can be bias and 30% of bias has caused misdiagnosing of patients so this proves that humans can be more bias than ai.  
If Con  you can outweigh their impact by citing statistiscal data of how ai can be more bias then that would help to strengthen your claim

## Pro  
None  

## Con  
None  

## Final decision  
Clashes  
1. learning outcome, con. Con could have explained this clash better though, by telling me why I should not believe in pro's statistics.  
2. cheating, con. Pro's nonunique attack was only defensive and not very convincing. Con had good stats.  
3. inequality, pro. Pro had a very good example of genAI used in rural communities in their constructive. Sadly this was not brought up ever again.  
4. teacher shortage, pro. Con has been attacking the false point, so pro's point stand.  
5. racial biases, Pro. Not discussed much in this debate. Pro said humans had more biases than humans and con never debated back. As only pro brought this up in ff, I had to buy this.  
  
This is a very close debate. I did not have a preference until the very end since I needed the debaters to weigh the clashes for me. Pro did better in final focus on sorting out what happened in the whole debate, bringing up many essential statements that were beneficial to their side. Also Pro showed better understanding of the topic by pointing out con's straw man, and explaining their points well.  
  
# Debate 30  

## Pro  
The pro side provides a clear link of why AI could fill the gap of teacher shortages.  
  
The pro side has also provided strong question in doubting the base quantity of students being surveyed of AI hurts their development while the con side fails to provide answers.  
  
The pro side also explains the need of  AI aids from those under-performed students.  

## Con  
The con side focuses on the bias and misleading factor amplified by the usage of AI in education field.  
  
The con side is able to provide a large quantity of data to support their points. You could work on the elaboration of data to better cope with crossfire and rebuttal.  

## Final decision  
The pro side proves that AI could save the preparation time for teachers and fill in the gap of teacher shortages. The pro side also pointed out the insuffiency of data, e.g. Chat GPT cannot represent all generative AI/magnitute of students being surgeyed, where the con side didn’t provide strong explinations.  
  
  
  
# Debate 31  

## Pro  
The pro side brings out the need of adapting to different working environments and AI helps them to do so.  
  
AI serves as a tool to help teachers is well-established.  
  
It’s not a key voting point but PF cares both evidence and logic, not “evidence only”.  

## Con  
Con raised an argument from a different angle that teachers currently are not trained to use AI at the first stage.  
  
The con side fails to prove why students will be relying on AI too much & how it harms their furture developments.  
  
It’s not a key voting issue but try to better organize the cards (with full article and hightlighted information).  

## Final decision  
The pro side has proven:  
-why AI helps teaches (44m teacher shortages will be filled)  
-how AI helps students future developments (students could adapt to different jobs in the future)  
-biased information are caused by people instead of AI  
  
  
  
# Debate 32  

## Pro  
1st - Many teachers have considered leaving the education field, but the logical link between this and addressing teacher-related issues is quite weak. Please be careful with your logic connections. The student's conclusion is not suitable as evidence of improved critical thinking skills, it’s not appropriate for the role of competitor and judge to be undertaken by the same person. The second point didn’t clearly highlight the differences between generative AI and traditional AI, so a deeper understanding of the debate topic is needed.  
2nd - Your opening response is well done, but it seems a bit lengthy. You only need to briefly mention: 1. Detection is becoming more accurate; 2. Policies are being implemented; 3. The benefits of generative AI far outweigh its downsides, specifically in etc. That would be sufficient. Additionally, please make a more distinct separation between concepts like generative AI and digital education.  

## Con  
1st - You mentioned statistics, so it would be best if you could provide specific figures. The second argument is somewhat repetitive of the first; consider presenting the first argument as an observation instead. Your sources seem a bit unusual, especially study.com/education.edu. It would be better to find a more credible source. The last argument lacks supporting evidence and should be treated as an extension rather than a main point. During crossfire, it’s unnecessary to question the sources. You can simply verify the evidence.  
2nd - Some parts of your response are well-addressed, but you didn’t provide a point-by-point rebuttal to the pro side’s contention. There’s no direct logical link between using AI and influencing a person’s character. The response to the second point is well done.  

## Final decision  
Con side. However, both sides have considerable room for improvement. The pro side's debate skills still need enhancement, particularly in crossfire, where they followed the con side's rhythm without posing their own questions. Both speakers demonstrate insufficient understanding of concepts related to the debate topic. The pro side should not introduce new evidence in the summary speech, but they did well in emphasizing why they should win. You might consider weighing the impact within the timeframe. The responses in the rebuttal speech were also quite weak. The con side's summary speech was not very effective, merely repeating their own points, and their contentions were somewhat limited. Overall, among the two points made by the pro side, the con side successfully countered one. The con side’s arguments went largely unaddressed by the pro side.  
  
# Debate 33  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: You did great in your constructive speech, try to have a clear and well organized contentions.  
  
  
Speaker 2: Global assesment and equal opportunity was well argued. In your rebuttal speech try to refute your opponents contentions alongside utilizing your arguments and evidences. You can provide the other apps available for referencing.  
  

## Con  
Speaker 1: International associations  
overreliance can affect the intectual development. 4 major academic database proves 28% loose decision making skills. potential harms outweigh the benefits, was well argued. Great crossfire  
  
Speaker 2: Trend in gen AI benefitting wealthy nations was well argued. Great rebuttal speech and final focus.  

## Final decision  
The two sides did well. The Con side won this debate. Though pro argues on educational equality  in constract pro argues 2.2 million people have no access to the use of AI.  
global inequality was well argued by the con side. pinpointing that the harm outweighes the benefit.   
  
# Debate 34  

## Pro  
Good debate especial good rebutall and crossfire. Good logical and reasoning ability.  

## Con  
 First speaker, Focus on Trying to speak more clearly and not to speak fast(During  Constructuve speech) so that the judge can make points for you.  
  
During the rebutall, the second speaker said that While Ai has some advantages there are many disadvantages. Always oppose the topic, never mention anything about advantages since you are opposing the topic  

## Final decision  
Con said AI is affecting productivity and employment,  because ai are doing tasks that teachers can do so they will be replaced and ai will make students cheat. pro said that research shows that42% of teachers in the UK needs AI and also for students and to help them to be more effective in their tasks Pro said students already cheat, ai doesn’t cause that. It’s not possible to change that. Pro stated that AI give more positive outcomes.  
Con said ai will assist students to provide all the answers. Pro said you need to use critical thinking to ask the ai questions and evaluate the information needed And that AI will not just give you the answer you need therefore the Quality of education will be improved overall with AI.  Ai  is a personalized system so students whether cheating or not it will still have benefit. And teachers check for Ai assisted documents so this is non-factor.  
  
  
Pro said ai are using ai, students, teachers. Pro said as it regards to misinformation/ information leaks that the con stated is not caused because of AI. This already existed before due to social media and other factors.   
  
Pro wins  
  
  
  
  
# Debate 35  

## Pro  
1st speaker: Only used 3min40s for your constructive, also add more evidence in your case.  
2nd speaker: Need much more evidence for your rebuttal, this is a PF debate.  
  

## Con  
1st speaker: Pretty mature case.  
2nd speaker: I mean, your opponent does not even have evidence in most of the contentions or rebuttal, just point it out, why wasting time explaining the basic logic over and over?  
  

## Final decision  
Here’s the reason why I’m voting for the CON side:  
1.     Framework  
PRO: N/A  
CON: N/A  
   
2.     Clashes  
A debate where a very simple judgment can be made. CON is already a very experienced and mature debater. Unfortunately, PRO seems to have just started PF. In most of PRO's contentions and rebuttals, they just discussed logic but could not provide evidence to prove their logic. In this case, the victory of this debate will easily belong to CON, considering all the strong evidence they provided.  
  
  
# Debate 36  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: framework: the side which can benefit from education and academic achievement.  
practice acheivement, accessibility and stability, diasbled was well argued.  
Great crossfire on university students not relying on AI but using it alongside.  
  
Speaker 2: great summary speech and crossfires arguments.  

## Con  
Speaker 1: possibilities: overeliance of AI can impact critical thinking. AI gives you the ability to learn independently. These are great points however, you can buttress your arguments with some evidences and impact weighing.  
Speaker 2: 37% of students cant use the internet. thus accessibiliy is vague, was well argued. Many program can support disability without having to use gen AI.  
Good analysis and impact on gen AI biasness. Great rebuttal and final focus.  

## Final decision  
Both teams did great. The Con side won this debate.   
Looking at the clash con argues on misinformation as well as more engament and clarification: con affirms this will depend on whether student are over reliant or not.   
Pro argues minority of students are harmed by Gen AI. Overall, Cons impact and analysis outweighed the pro side.  
  
# Debate 37  

## Pro  
1st - Your first argument regarding math education is somewhat unclear in distinguishing between generative AI and traditional AI. The other evidence, however, effectively supports your viewpoint.  
2nd - "We should look to the future of AI, not stop to criticize it." This is excellent. However, the earlier response seemed a bit lengthy, which made the final remarks somewhat brief. It would be beneficial to pay more attention to time management.  

## Con  
1st - The summary at the beginning of your speech makes it feel a bit disorganized. It would be better to explain each contention one by one. Overall, the constructive speech is quite well done; your points are clear, and there are logical connections between each contention, supported by solid evidence.  
2nd - Your responses are very robust, but it's important to maintain a balance. You can't just state that the internet is an established fact and that generative AI benefits only wealthy groups. You need to provide a solution; otherwise, even a small benefit remains a benefit, and only when the benefits are significant can they be expanded to a larger audience.  

## Final decision  
Both sides performed very well in their constructive and rebuttal speeches, especially in the rebuttal speeches, where they effectively utilized various debate skills to respond to the opposing side's contentions and questions. However, the con's constructive speech was more structured and clearer in its interpretation of contentions compared to the pro side. For the second speaker, remember to focus on asking questions during crossfire rather than answering them. Additionally, the pro first speaker should refrain from asking questions in the second crossfire. In the con's summary, it would be beneficial to explain it in conjunction with their framework, highlighting to the judges why the present is more important than the future. Notably, the con did not directly address the contentions related to AI's potential to enhance education or intelligence during this debate.  
  
# Debate 38  

## Pro  
The 2nd speaker has provdied arguments that AI could be trained with different database to diminish the possibility of generating biased information.  
  
Good responses in crossfire concerning equality discussions.   
  
Good analysis during rebuttal, crossfire and final focus.  

## Con  
Con side has provided with the usage of AI, gender biased information are more likely to be displayed.  
  
Con side has also provided data that education inequality will be widened with the use of AI.   
  
At the first part of the debate your team is doing well. However, conflicts reveals when you’ve start discussing on the equality of educations. If student cannot even use AI, then the problems caused by AI also don’t exist.  

## Final decision  
Pro side wins on the consistancy of arguments. Teachers could decide the usage of AI in education. The biased issue raised by con could be solved by either more data base or the supervision of human beings.   
  
  
  
# Debate 39  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: Efficiency, tech gap, minority, teachers. Asked for quantifiable data in the crossfire. The summary used a little too much time on clarifying issues of minor importance  
  
Speaker 2: Precise question in the crossfire. The developing trend of AI should be better demonstrated. Also, shouldn't dodged all the abuse problems with AI abuse.  

## Con  
Speaker 1: financial lost, biases. To much personal accusations in the summary. Should better summarize the clashes and try to group the points together. Making your opponents seem stupid doesn't help you win the round.  
  
Speaker 2: Great line by line rebuttal. Should have a broader scope in how to win the round as a whole. Don't get stuck on the nitty gritty.   

## Final decision  
Both sides are great at spotting the minor logical fallacies in the statements of their opponents. But I think both teams need to work on how this fits into a grand overall strategy of winning the debate round. AI bias, for example, the debates could easily move on to the next level by weighing whether the problem is magnified by the use of AI in education. At the end of the day, this became a really painful decision as I have to dive back into the flow and search for standing impacts and arguments. It's a slight advantage for the pro but both teams have a lot to improve.  
  
# Debate 40  

## Pro  
Strong argument of AI could help disabled students learn better. But both or your arguments, how AI helps disabled students & personalized learning could be supported with more evidence.  
  
“Students could tell by their common sense” may not be a strong response when con side has provides evidences of students’ learning ability being harmed by AI.  

## Con  
Dependency/privacy/misleading information caused by the usage of AI are well-supported with data.  
  
Good answers in crossfire that students need a reference as a guidance. Otherwise students cannot tell what is right and what is wrong.  
  
“According to the internet” might not be a credible source.  

## Final decision  
Con side wins on better understanding of the topic. The con side is able to clarify how AI causes trouble to students in building their learning habits.  
All of their arguments are well-supported with data or researches.  
  
The pro side failes to provide enough data to support their arguments.  
  
# Debate 41  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: Teacher workload. Good structure and clear delivery. Could address the questions more directly.  
  
Speaker 2:The responses were good but some failed to directly address the points raised by the con side. Could use more precise claims.  

## Con  
Speaker 1: The speech was good. Nice use of evidence. The contentions seemed a little disconnected. Try to put them under a coherent framework.  
  
Speaker 2: Bad crossfire manner to talk over your opponents during crossfire. The rebuttal was generally good, the uses of evidence could be more precise. The speeches were pre-written  

## Final decision  
The pro tried to flip the case of the con side by asking for alternatives. The con side could stress a little more on the points that were dropped in the round.  
The crossfires were not constructive. Both sides relied heavily on pre-written materials and didn't have much insights into this specific round. A lot of points were also dropped in the course of the debate, making it hard for the judge to make a meaning weighing at the end of the round. Overall all, it's a close round in favor of the pro.  
  
# Debate 42  

## Pro  
Good impact evidence; but could use stronger link. Need better interpretation of some cards, ex., what is acuracy rate? What is 99% rate of human error? 85/95% accuracy rate isnêt exactly high. Fine point on specialization, but what do you mean by productivity in education? C2 overall very weak in link. Environmental impact is very remote and indirect. So is poverty. Need much stronger link and details.  
Rebuttal flow is good but too defensive. responses based on speculation(kids donêt reveal info. Really?) and extreme counterexample (of CUHK).  
Efficient summary and ff.   

## Con  
Need better interpretation of your numbers: what is accuracy in learning outcome? On overreliance need to go farther on why AI canêt be contained. for CII, could strengthen the uniqueness of privacy concern in edu context. Whatês the caption of 3rd contention? Feels too defensive for case.  
Rebuttal could use better signposting. Overall need much more substantive arguments in response.  
Summary: you cannot concede that AI is more accurate. Teachers losing jobs sound a less serious problem than education spreading misinformation.  

## Final decision  
Pro ballot. Proês been consistent with their utilitarian framework. Their general argument on AI improving education inequality (helping with personalized learning for marginalized groups) and improving education efficiency (good accuracy and doing repeitive task) generally stands. Conês concern for ai overreliance and data security made sense but are not backed up by good evidence, but by rather arbitrary assumptions. They fail to prove the imagined worst case scenario to be the general case. Little uniqueness is provided from con.  
  
# Debate 43  

## Pro  
1st speaker: Wasted 3 min on finding a card is not a good idea in debate.  
2nd speaker: Prepare for more blocks for your rebuttal. Your improvision is not good right now. Confusing crossfire questions.  
  

## Con  
1st speaker: Why don’t you take prep for your summary?  
2nd speaker: Good card check, help you to win the debate.  
  

## Final decision  
Here’s the reason why I’m voting for the CON side:  
1.     Framework  
PRO: repeat contentions  
CON: N/A  
   
2.     Clashes  
(1)   Cheating  
CON wins this clash for a simple reason: CON successfully proves that Gen AI will lead to more rampant cheating among students. The evidence used by PRO that schools allow the use of AI has also been proven to be invalid (because PRO cannot provide the original text). Con wins this clash.  
   
(2)   Biased information  
CON also successfully proves that AI will have a lot of biased information (80% wrong), which will have a very bad impact on students. PRO's only rebuttal is that teachers also have biases. But CON has given a comparative proof that AI will spread biased information more widely. Con wins this clash.  
   
(3)   Personalized learning  
PRO thinks that AI can give students a lot of customized personal teaching experience, which teachers cannot do. But CON also mentioned that long-term exposure to Gen AI will make students out of touch with reality and unable to get any emotional support from teachers. I think both sides have reasons on this point, but they are analyzed from different angles. Tie on this point.

# Debate 44  

## Pro  
1st - There isn’t a direct logical link between teacher turnover and generative AI. However, the explanation of how AI can assist teachers was very clear. The second and third contentions were quite original, but I didn’t fully understand the last point, which needs more detailed explanation. The refutation in the summary was slightly lengthy, but overall, the summary section was well done, with a good emphasis on impact.  
2nd - It’s necessary to respond in the rebuttal speech to the questions the other side raised during crossfire. In other areas, you did very well, directly addressing the strengths of your own contentions and providing detailed explanations or evidence.  

## Con  
1st - The constructive speech was very persuasive, with all contentions logically connected, which is excellent. You were very good at capturing the main points in crossfire. However, the summary did not identify the main clash.  
2nd - The first response made a good point, but you didn’t provide evidence to support the claim of teachers' over-reliance. In most of your speech, you didn’t directly respond to the opponent’s contentions but instead focused more on exploring your own contentions.  

## Final decision  
Overall, the Pro side conducted more thorough research, showing a deeper understanding of the topic. Their impact was also well-aligned with their framework.  
  
# Debate 45  

## Pro  
chatbox example perhaps a bit too trivial for your CI argument? 84% accuracy sounds rather low.  
2.5billion disabled people?? Could be more concrete on the link of how AI help the marginalized/disabled. Nice countering bias in 1st cf, though language could be better polished.  
rebuttal: on AT data privacy: what u mentioned as tool to improve cybersecurity doesnêt sound a case of [GEN]AI, but just machine learning and data tools. Nice flow overall.  

## Con  
Could gain better familiarity w case. Good evi on 1.2% data leak, but could provide more contexts and proper citation. A bit too brief w link. Need stronger impacts and qualified examination or even definition of bias.   
rebuttal too defensive: you canêt possibly blame chatgpt for not having as many users as google? this is hardly an inherent harm or limitation of genAI. Insufficient access to GPT only testified a need for more widespread deployment, isnêt it?  
could cite qualified cases of harm of data insecurity.  

## Final decision  
Grandcrossfire rather messy. as the use of AI is quite reasonably widespread, challenging on the exact number of people having access to AI is marginal at best. Con is only using the most narrow conception of çuseé, while their fixation on certain portion of people on earth being too poor or not having internet does not help their case on the fundamental harm of AI compared to the benefits.   
Con has some valid argument on data security, but overall doesnêt make a general case of positive harm, and not much unique impact of GENAI in education is brought up. Proês argument on education equity and efficiency practically unchallenged.  
  
# Debate 46  

## Pro  
1st speaker: Sometimes when you talk too fast, you will make the judge unable to catch all of your key information.  
2nd speaker: Off-time roadmap is useless, trust me.  
  

## Con  
1st speaker: Good structure for your summary speech.  
2nd speaker: good final focus, but you should consider not using the logic chain of one clash point as the base of the other one. Avoid correlation between clash points when the debate is very close.  
  

## Final decision  
Here’s the reason why I’m voting for the PRO side:  
1.     Framework  
PRO: N/A  
CON: N/A  
   
2.     Clashes  
(1)   Poverty and accessibility  
PRO emphasized that we need to use AI to help the poor in the world so that they can also have enough access to education. CON's main rebuttal is that the poor are a small part of the world, not the majority, and we should focus on the interests of the majority of people with shareholders. But as PRO said, the poor themselves are actually a vulnerable group that needs to be paid attention to. Both sides are right on this point, but they are standing from different perspectives. TIE on this point.  
   
(2)   Efficiency  
PRO emphasized that as teachers use Gen AI in large quantities, the teaching efficiency of teachers and schools will be greatly improved, which can save schools billions of dollars and improve the quality of teaching. CON did not respond well to this point (as can be seen from the questions raised by their grand cf), Pro wins this point.  
   
(3)   False information  
CON believes that AI will generate a lot of wrong or biased information. But PRO provided data to prove that AI tools can identify 92% of wrong information. Then CON also mentioned that having a tool to identify wrong information does not mean that students will really use this tool to identify what they have learned. I think both sides have a point on this point. TIE on this point.  
  
  
# Debate 47  

## Pro  
1st - Using students' own evaluations as evidence is not particularly effective; student outcomes should be assessed by a third party or objective tests. You didn't explain how AI functions within the framework you proposed; you only briefly mentioned the outcomes. Your response in crossfire was good. The summary was very clear, and you thoroughly recapped the entire debate. 2nd - “con, you are doing nothing" response, combined with the earlier response about university policies, was well-executed. However, here you could emphasize that generative AI indeed improves students' intelligence.  

## Con  
1st - This was a very well-structured constructive speech, including all the necessary sections. There was a good logical flow between the first and second arguments. For the third contention, it would be better if a solution were provided. In the summary, it would be best to include impact weighing, as well as a better summary of the clashes.  
2nd - It would be best to add some evidence in your speech to support your points. You mainly focused on further explaining your contentions, but didn’t use debate techniques to emphasize why the other side shouldn’t win and the specific reasons why your arguments are stronger. In the final focus, you shouldn’t just say that you’ve responded to the points; you should highlight the most crucial points.  

## Final decision  
Pro. The Con side had an excellent constructive speech, but their understanding of the resolution was indeed not as strong as the Pro side. The Pro side did a great job interpreting the resolution and linking it to their own framework, consistently emphasizing impact throughout the debate, which they did better than the Con side.  
  
# Debate 48  

## Pro  
1st - For your contention, you need to differentiate between AI and generative AI; currently, what you’ve presented is non-unique. There could be a logical link between the first contention and the third contention, so consider combining them. In the constructive speech, you offered solutions to the relevant issues. You also did well in the summary speech, providing a fairly complete summary of the debate and using debate skills effectively.  
2nd - The rebuttal speech was very clear, directly explaining why you should win and providing supporting evidence.  

## Con  
1st - You need to clearly state the impact of privacy breaches. You mentioned that AI can assist teachers but cannot replace them. However, the resolution and the pro side did not bring this point up. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the resolution, so please pay attention to the resolution again; otherwise, your argument could become a point for the other side to counter. In the summary speech, try to further explore your own argument.  
2nd - Overall, it was well done, but it would be better to directly present an argument rather than responding solely with evidence.  

## Final decision  
Both sides performed very well in this debate, displaying politeness without being overly aggressive. All speeches were very clear. It’s important to point out specific issues with the evidence after checking it. Overall, the pro side demonstrated better debate skills and depth in presenting their views compared to the con side.  
  
# Debate 49  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: Student engagement. Great and clear delivery and nice preparations. Quick responses in crossfire. The summary was overall good, but could be more concise and use more sign posting.   
  
Speaker 2: Could have addressed the questions raised by the con side more directly. Should have made the points more explicit. Don't ask open ended questions.   

## Con  
Speaker 1: Asked for clarification in the first crossfire. A bit nervous while giving the speech. Should have left more time for clash summarization.   
  
Speaker 2: Questioned the trend of AI development. Defended with topicality. Great responses on uniqueness. Asked about definition in grand cross.   

## Final decision  
The teams ended up having a definition debate in grand cross. The pro side dodged the impacts abuse and reliance by uniqueness and topicality. At the end of the day, the only standing impact of the con side is misinformation and hallucination caused by Gen AI. Both sides failed to advance deeper into the problem and left the debate on a rather shallow level. At the end of the day, there is a small advantage for the pro side as they managed to leave more standing impacts on the ground.  
  
# Debate 50  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: education sector increasing. Cost reduction. Education gap. Tried to demonstrate the closing of digital gap. Could extend the logic instead of repeating the evidence.  
  
Speaker 2: High quality data sets. 3% mostly generated by AI. Contribution to education.   

## Con  
Speaker 1: Bias. Should have moved on to the next question more quickly in the first crossfire.   
  
Speaker 2: The responses could use more evidence to support the claims. Could improve the logic in the speech. Some of the strategies are questionable.   

## Final decision  
The con side had trouble answering questions using the status quo as examples, should have made direct responses. The pro side have more standing impacts as the con side failed to make direct responses to most of the arguments. The pro side could do a better job by using evidence at the proper spot.  
  
# Debate 51  

## Pro  
1st - The overall structure is relatively clear, but it would be better to group similar points together. It would also be beneficial to emphasize the impact. 2nd - The rebuttal speech was well executed, summarizing the opponent’s key points and even referencing content from the crossfire. You could identify the core issues in the opponent's arguments, particularly regarding discrimination and generative AI. However, it would be best to offer solutions. For example, regarding unemployment, you could further explain through your framework why machines can’t fully replace humans. As you pointed out, while machines may have high accuracy, they may struggle to understand the choices humans make, which highlights how machines can help humans recognize their own limitations.  

## Con  
1st - The argument linking unemployment to death is too remote from today’s topic. The last point is excellent and quite original, but it seems somewhat removed from the education system. If you want to substantiate this point, you should demonstrate that generative AI plays a significant role in education. 2nd - I’m not sure your point is accurate—AI may provide better resources for wealthier students, but that doesn’t necessarily lead to educational inequality; the logic is similar to higher education, where it can’t be generalized. From another perspective, only when technology reaches a certain level of development does its price drop; development always follows a process. Some other arguments still don’t directly respond to the pro side. For instance, schools lacking motivation to hire teachers is not inherently an AI issue but rather a problem of capitalism.  

## Final decision  
Pro side. Overall, I personally believe that the pro side has a better understanding and interpretation of the resolution than the con side. The con side’s arguments seem somewhat too assertive and don’t carefully address the inherent issues of AI and its application within the education system. The problems raised by the con side are somewhat removed from AI itself, relying on assumptions. However, the con side still performed well, achieving logical coherence in their speeches and supporting their points with evidence.  
  
# Debate 52  

## Pro  
Great clarity and organisation of your arguments, clear definition. The teaching shortage argument is presented with clear structure.  
Need to improve specificity of your rebuttal, need to directly address on your opponents; argument.  
Try not to over-exaggerate your impact.  
I would suggest more research on the general competency of AI and its potential, it will reinforce your argument of solving teaching shortage.  

## Con  
Great delivery and well argued contentions.  
Second contention lacking relevance to the education topic. Mis-representation of global opinion also has a matter of its audience.  
Could question the competency of the AI.  

## Final decision  
This is a CON ballot. The CON side won mainly because of their well-rounded and reasoned argument of over-reliance, the impact is harmful and can be already seen throught the evidence they provided. Pro didn’t give direct response to the main argument, also oversold their own contention through exaggerating the impact of work-force replacement.  
  
# Debate 53  

## Pro  
The constructive speech effectively elucidated how the benefits of AI, including accessibility and reduced workload for teachers, outweigh the harms. This argument was supported by well-cited references and compelling data statistics.  
Logically and skillfully defended crossfire, by raising  good questions.  
2nd: During the rebuttal, the crossfire clash was handled effectively, with each contention systematically addressed using logical reasoning.  
They defended the crossfire very well, demonstrating strong argumentation skills and effectively countering opposing points.  

## Con  
The constructive speech laid a robust groundwork for the harms of AI, particularly focusing on issues of data privacy, dependency, ethical concerns, and the risks of misinformation and biased information.  
Crossfire require more solid and logical reasoning    
The speaker effectively refuted each of the opponent's arguments with reasoning and supported their stance on the accessibility for using AI with relevant data.  
Effectively summarized, offering a precise analysis of the critical clashes   

## Final decision  
I will vote for PRO side because   
-the team exhibited adept handling of clashes, particularly in presenting compelling arguments regarding over-reliance as well as the reliability of AI. Their points were underpinned by strong references and logical reasoning.  
The CON side also debated well however   
-the speaker encountered difficulties in delivering effective responses to the questions posed during crossfire. -also failed to adequately defend their points about ethical concerns and critical thinking   
  
# Debate 54  

## Pro  
Good job in checking for evidence abot how unemployment  rate and  suicide rates are linked which the con side struggled to answer. however be careful to not make contradictions to your own statements which the opponent can exploit.  

## Con  
During the debate the con side stated that some information provided about unemployment is  based on theri onwn logic and not based on factual evidence. Please take note of this because pro exploited this weakness in your arguments in the beginning  

## Final decision  
Pro: Need 44 million teachers globally by 2040, teachers are reporting high levels of stress. Half of the teachers are looking to resign from their job. Gen ai can help teacher to automate tasks so that they can reduce time by 30%. Reduction of stress and working hours will help them to be enthuasiastic to keep their job. This will make the students suffer , ai can help increase student-teacher interaction. Students will use ai to help them to obtain good results and improve their skills.   
  
Con: Mass unemployment , ai will replace teachers then it can be non beneficial. English and math teachers are already being replaced and make ai uses creative method and make personalized classes. 215 million people currently use ai and will increase three-fold in the coming years. Employers will choose ai over teachers making a negative impact of the 100 million teachers around the world. Unemployment affects the crime rate and suicide rate will cause ripple effects in society and cause social rest, collapsing economy. If teachers were to be unemployed it would take a great hit on the economy of each country impacting every single country.  
  
  
  
Pro said that 75% of job markets will be adopted in the future so ai in the education field will help students to prepare for the future and help them to find jobs and succeed in their future jobs. Said they only talked about unemployment for teachers , they didn’t talk about about how it affects the students. There cases are highly based on assumptions.  
  
Con said using ai in school will not prepare students for the real world. Said there impact is only targeted to students, logical chain is untrue and there is no logic between using ai in school will help students prepare for the future. Using ai will make them lazier.  Con further stated in the debate that pro stated that they “cons side” cannot make predictions on the future which also contradicts their own arguments about future statements which the pro side is making  
  
Pro said the teachers will have decreased work load con said that is the point, con statedthe fact that teachers are working less because of ai then this will replace teachers. Pro said work load and stress is one of the ways that teachers quit their job and ai will help them.  
Con said evidence is contradicting because there are 44 million jobs that are needed for teachers and  with less work load from ai they will not need as many teachers.   
 Cons win  
  
  
# Debate 55  

## Pro  
I would suggest you to slow down a little to make it more audible. well-supported contention 1, with its benefits well-explained. Good research and understanding of how AI gives more access to certain knowledge.  
Your non-unique response to cyber-crime is clearly not sufficient.  
Logically slightly weak by relying your beneficial argument on the use rate.  

## Con  
Great delivery of constructive speech. Contention 1 specificity to topic can be improved. Although its impact is solid and well-explained.  
I would like to hear more on the last point of your constructive, of hindering economic participation.  
Good correlation causation rebuttal.  
I would suggest to cut some of your contention 1  

## Final decision  
This is a close round with CON slightly edging on the ballot. I believe CON during this debate has more thorough reasoning on the competency of AI, given more analysis. CON convinced me that AI is overall harmful given their concrete impact, their cyber-crime and bias argument although lacking specificity, were given weak non-uniqueness response which aren’t enough. PRO cannot simply argue AI is beneficial by giving access if they fail to prove their competency.  
  
# Debate 56  

## Pro  
Explained throughly from the beginning many advantages of ai through assisting teachers with grading, students with studying, helping with unemployment and poverty. Provided a plethora of examples of the ways generative ai can be beneficial while consistently discrediting opponents points and asking for evidence which the con side struggled to reply to. Excellent job  

## Con  
Work on crossfire skills, there were questions posed in the crossfire for example when pro asked about how students are overreliant on ai, con struggled to answer this question. Additionally, It is recommended to present information with statistical data that will help to back up your claims and make it harder for the opponent to challenge your points. work on reducing filler words like "umm".  

## Final decision  
AI advantages vs disadvantages  
  
Pro: Generative ai wont replace teachers, used as a tool. Assist study by reducing studying time by 27% and improve performance by 8%. Assist teachers in marking students work faster by 70%. 80% of teachers have positive remarks about ai. AI helps to simplify tasks.  
  
Enables poor and disabled students to learn more. Lack of resources and education for poor children. 38% of college students drop out because of financial issues. Ai can help underprivileged situation can get access to education for  just 4-17dollars a month.  
  
Con stated as it regards to poverty he doesn’t think that ai will help will this, pro said that they need evidence and data bout this, it is not what the opponents thinks. Cons struggled to back up their claims with evidence and statistical data. When asked question about how are students is the over-reliant on ai. Con struggled to answer this question.   
  
  
Pro asked for evidence that if ai in education that the rate of cheating will increase. Con gave  his own personal examples of situations with cheating and pro stated that this may not be factual information that can be applied everywhere. Cons struggled to answer how their side can have a greater impact in the final crossfire, they also struggled to answer this question  
  
Pro wins  
  
  
# Debate 57  

## Pro  
Educational reforms and educational inequality  were discussed in the constructive speech with clarity and supported by well-cited references, data, facts, and figures.   
The speaker skillfully navigated the crossfire round by posing insightful questions.  
During rebuttal, each point of contention was skillfully addressed with logical reasoning and backed by numerous statistical data  
Furthermore, the debate was effectively summarized, offering a precise analysis of the critical clashes and arguments during the final focus.  

## Con  
The constructive speech established a comprehensive framework highlighting the lack of critical thinking, particularly focusing on issues such as dependency on AI, biased or inaccurate data, and a lack of creativity and innovation. However, adding more information and facts might make the arguments made even more compelling.  
Crossfire needs additional logical reasoning   
In the rebuttal phase, every contention was skillfully tackled with logical reasoning   
The summary part can be improved to create a stronger impact by concisely reinforcing the key arguments and emphasizing their significance.  

## Final decision  
My reasons for voting on the PRO side include  
-their efficient handling of clashes about over-reliance of students on AI was commendable. They succeeded in their arguments due to robust logical reasoning backed by relevant statistical data.  
Contrarily, the CON side   
-exhibited a deficiency in reasoning, particularly evident during the crossfire rounds especially coating contradicting statement against their own arguments  
  
# Debate 58  

## Pro  
Slow down during your delivery, your contention 1 was hardly audible.   
You could have better structure of your case, the arguments are little statistics-dependent, reasons for arguments should be added.  
It is not a code of conduct but your crossfire is lacking manner and it doesn’t help just reiterating your speech instead of letting the debate progress.  
Lacking response to the copyright argument.  
  

## Con  
Strong contention 1, the relevance of the copyright point could be improved, as for education purpose.  
I would love to hear you elaborate on the impact of harmful stereotypes.  
The argument of access inequality could be better layered and argued, it is a argument that admit the benefit. If you really want to run this argument properly, you can set a relative framework that argue the importance of equality of access, or channel that argument to counter your opponent.  

## Final decision  
I am sorry that I only included things to improve in the comment sections.  
This is a PRO ballot with a slight margin. Although the reasoning of the arguments are lacking, the dry statistics of how GAI improve test score etc. CON’s main argument of unequal access gives pro the benefit, the rest of the arguments lack impacts specific to education benefits. Thanks for the debate!  
  
# Debate 59  

## Pro  
Good job to ask for statistical data to prove that using ai does not prove over-reliance and also to note that there were questions that were asked that the opponent failed to reply to.   

## Con  
try to answer questions directly that would help to defend your stance. Opponent asked many times to give a percentage on students that are overreliant on ai.   

## Final decision  
AI RELIANCE  
  
Con: Decrease the overall quality of education because students are over reliant on these ai tools.   
  
Decrease in total overall connection between teacher and students. Students perception of the need for teachers are being reduced. Use of Ai  will worsen the problem. Teachers are become reliant of ai detection tool to detect ai generated work but 25% of teachers said the apps are inefficient at detecting ai generated homework which can substantially impact learning. 68.9% of students are more lazy due to ai and degrades their creative thinking  
  
  
Pro: Increase efficiency and effectivity of education. Allows teachers to structure their work more effectively and make lessons according to their students need.  Ai provides Immediate responses, provided students with feedback when teachers are not available. Enable students to learn without the reliance on teachers.  
  
Offer personalize learning experience, in classrooms many students are unable to keep up with the pacing of classes.  Personalized ai learning has help reduced the learning gap. Allows students to explore topic outside of their curriculum, gives students a sense of ownership over their own learning.  
  
Pro: Low chance of overreliance because over 50% of student use ai for brain storming and students in turkey had over 40% increase in grades after using AI. The Motion is to prove that it bring more benefits that harms which they have already proved. And wanting to use ai does not prove over-reliant on  ai as they did not give any statistics on this. Con said How can you ensure that low cost ai isnt providing low value information. Pro said there is not a lower quality of education and higher scores means that the education is improving pro stated Chatgpt has help over 30000 students pass their courses. Benefits a large part of the population.  
Pro wins  
  
# Debate 60  

## Pro  
I do not see a major issue with your debate skills, but maybe focus less on evidence next time.   
   

## Con  
1. build your card!!  
2. crossfire skill need significant improvement  
3. speaker 2 need to speak during crossfire  

## Final decision  
1. shortage on teacher:pro win, as con is not able to provide a solvency  
2. AI mis information: con win, there is a 20% inaccuracy, although pro mentioned it is adjustable,  but not how.  
3. bias: pro win, although con mentioned a percentage, but did not quantifying what the data is based on  
Besides the main clash, overall con had less impact on most points, most evidence is not fulled extended and some are missing trustworthy  source.   
  
# Debate 61  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: The constructive is okay. Could use a better strategy by linking the arguments together.   
  
Speaker 2: Should have addressed the most important issue of inequality first. Some of the responses weren't in the education industry.   

## Con  
Speaker 1: The speaker seemed a little bit unfamiliar with the case. Nice working pushing on digital inequality in cf.   
  
Speaker 2: Too much time spent on a single point. The delivery could use some improvement, too much reading. Good use of evidence.  

## Final decision  
The pro side won on instant feedback and accuracy. However, they failed to demonstrate how these benefits could be applied in an global level. The benefits raised by pro were mostly small increments to current systems than game changers. The con had impacts on a larger scope and more profound influence.  
  
# Debate 62  

## Pro  
Very clear delivery of your arguments, contentions are well-structured as they also correspond to each others.  
As you stated in your contention 1 AI will retackle the teaching shortage, perhaps an assesssment of their use in teaching could be helpful.  
Good and thorough rebuttal, a bit ambitious as you didn’t argue with enough reasons and metholodies to why ai would just make student identify validity.  
Doesn’t generative AI create problem in the job market, which hinder the benefit on employability.  

## Con  
Well-focused contentions, very centered on unequal access.  
The impact of harmful stereotypes also its reasoning could be better argued.  
Good response of lacking decision skills, need more reasoning of why it benefits their life.  
Avoid giving generic statement on racial or other kind of harmful stereotypes, cases and specification can be helpful.  

## Final decision  
It is a PRO ballot with a slight margin. By purely arguments matching PRO wins, the logic is clear on both of the contentions and the problems are urgent to the matter of education.  
Although PRO’s vision to the future isn’t convincing. CON’s unequal access argument give benefits to PRO, plus they dropped their own contention 1. Although the harmful stereotype impact stands, PRO’s impacts outweigh.  
  
# Debate 63  

## Pro  
1. although speeding reading seems to get more information into the case, but making people  missing a lot information  
2. listen to your opponent more careful, your flow certainly miss something  
3. try not to speak at the same time during crossfire  
   

## Con  
1. mask for speaker point 29-27  
2. less interruption during crossfire  
3. try not to speak at the same time during crossfire  
4. do not drop your opponent points  
   

## Final decision  
According to the topic, this is debate is based on cost benefit analysis  
1. equality: con win, although pro proved that AI lesson is cheap, but con is able to prove in her evidence that even in developed countries there are school who have no access to Internet  
2.education quality: con win, AI is about pure knowledge, but not interaction  
3. environmental discable: dropped, pro win  
4. cheating: con win, pro attacked with lack of evidence, but con did provided evidence that proved the point  
  
# Debate 64  

## Pro  
Speaker 1: Nice job viewing the issue over a longer time span, seeing how the problems identified could be resolved in the long run. The shortage of teacher and teaching quality is a good point.  
  
Speaker 2: Directly addressed most of the points raised by the con. The rebuttal could, however, use a better sign posting.   
  
Generally we don't need off-time road maps in PF  

## Con  
Speaker 1:Experienced a bit tech issues. Some of the statements weren't quite audible. Could use better crossfire strategies. Don't directly ask your opponents for evidence.  
  
Speaker 2: The responses were clear but a bit off points. Could use more links and evidence to directly address the weak spots in pro's case.   
  

## Final decision  
Both teams could use a better prep time strategy. The con side should have checked the 44 million teacher shortage and question the very foundation of this set of arguments. Time wasted on insignificant matters. The con side stuck to the same set of logic that did born certain significance but the pro side offered more impacts overall.   
  
# Debate 65  

## Pro  
Good job as it regards to opposing each of the opponents points on education, education inequality. rebuttal was organized breaking down many of the opponents points  

## Con  
Good job in providing information on your position but also be prepared to oppose and counter your opponents arguments more effectively. For example the opponent already countered your argument on education inequality on the crossfire but in the rebuttal the con repeated the same point that was made before that already got countered previously.  
  
  
  

## Final decision  
 Education  
Con:  in educational field are threatened by ai. If they can prove ai wont improve grades then they will win.  
Lack of independent learning, students lose the ability of critical thinking degrading human skills and knowledge. 31% of high school Students and 42% of university use ai to complete assignments and rely on cheating to get good grades.   
    
Pro: Said there points only focus on students but they pro side stated how it benefits both the teachers, students and the economy so they outweigh the con side on impact.  
100% of students stated that ai help with brain storming, organizing information. 20-40% of teacher activity are spent on tasks that teachers could use to help ai to automate their job and reduce their workload by 13 hours and helping them to focus on students more.  
  
  
  
Education Inequality  
Con said that AI Creates education inequality. People in poor areas also may not have access to ai tools and also cant afford the computers. Pro said ai is more accessible to students whenever and wherever they are. With normal class size teachers cannot give the students the attention they need. Ai gives students access to information 24/7. Students using ai get a 30% improvement in grades  
  
Pro stated that it helps Personalized teaching /tutoring cost 25-100 dollars per hours.  AI tutoring is a fraction of the  cost 10-25 per month. Thus solving the accessibility and cost issue. Tuition is expensive and it has to be paid every year while if you purchase  a computer and pay for ai tools and this is more cost effective way to educate yourself.  
Pro wins the debate
