# Summary
“Generative AI could actually enhance the overall learning experience, by cutting down on administrative work and maximizing human interaction, as well as by reskilling or upskilling workers whose jobs have been affected by the technology,” says Brenda Duverce, an analyst on the Morgan Stanley Sustainability Research team. “**These and other efficiencies could bring $200 billion in value to the global education sector by 2025**, which could ultimately translate to higher revenue and lower costs for the best-positioned EdTech companies.”
