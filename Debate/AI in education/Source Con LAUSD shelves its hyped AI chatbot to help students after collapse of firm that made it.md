# Summary

A much vaunted AI chatbot — custom designed to help students thrive academically and parents navigate the complexities of Los Angeles public schools — has been turned off after the company that created it furloughed “the vast majority” of its staff.

The school district said it dropped its dealings with AllHere, the company that created “Ed,” the sun-shaped chatbot, after “we were notified of their financial collapse.” AllHere did not respond to an inquiry this week from The Times and the level of its operation is unclear.

Meanwhile, the district unplugged the chatbot — for which AllHere had been paid $3 million — on June 14, less than three months after unveiling the animated figure as an easy-to-use, conversational companion for students and a soon-to-be-indispensable guide for parents. “Ed” is both a chatbot, personified as a happy, round sun, and an online platform that attempts to put together in one portal student records, assignments, grades, academic recommendations and mental health referrals.

# Debate block
Ed, an AI chatbot meant to help teach students, shut down less than 3 months after being introduced by the LA United school district, after they spent 3 million dollars on buying the chatbot. AllHere, the company behind Ed, had struggled with financial issues and was forced to shut down almost all of its operations.
