# Abstract

This study evaluates the impact of Rori, an AI powered conversational math tutor accessible via WhatsApp, on the math performance of approximately 1,000 students in grades 3-9 across 11 schools in Ghana. Each school was assigned to a treatment group or control group; the students in the control group continued their regular math instruction, while students in the treatment group engaged with Rori, for two 30-minute sessions per week over 8 months in addition to regular math instruction. We find that the **math growth scores were substantially higher for the treatment group with an effect size of 0.37**, and that the results were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The fact that Rori works with basic mobile devices on low-bandwidth data networks gives the intervention strong potential to support personalized learning on other low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), where laptop ownership and high-speed internet - prerequisite for many video-centered learning platforms - remain extremely limited. While the results should be interpreted judiciously, as they only report on year 1 of the intervention, and future research is necessary to better understand which conditions are necessary for successful implementation, they do suggest that chat-based tutoring solutions leveraging artificial intelligence could offer a costeffective approach to enhancing learning outcomes for millions of students globally.

# Notes

To assess the impact of using Rori on learning, growth scores were computed by sub-
tracting baseline raw scores, the number of questions answered correctly, from endline
raw scores for each student who completed both tests. An independent samples t-test
between the control (M = 2.12, SD = 6.30) and the treatment group (M = 5.13, SD =
7.03) revealed that the **3.01 difference in growth scores** was highly statistically signifi-
cant (p < 0.001).

The assessment consisted of **35 questions**, each worth one point, with a mixture of multiple-choice and open-response questions covering numeracy and algebra skills from grades 3 to 5 on the Global Proficiency Framework.

3/35 = 8.5%

The calculated effect size between the baseline and endline, expressed as Cohen's d, was found to be 0.36. This effect size would be considered a moderate to large effect size in educational re-
search. Hattie et al. would categorize 0.29 as moderate, and similar to the magnitude of the effect of a good teacher . Whereas Kraft proposes argued that educational interventions with an 0.20 SD of over should be considered as large.
