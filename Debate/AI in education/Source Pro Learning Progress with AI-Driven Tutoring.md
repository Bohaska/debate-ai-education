# Abstract
 Generative AI is expected to have a vast, positive impact on education; however, at present, this potential has not yet been demonstrated at scale at university level. In this study, we present first evidence that generative AI can increase the speed of learning substantially in university students. We tested whether using the AI-powered teaching assistant Syntea affected the speed of learning of hundreds of distance learning students across more than 40 courses at the IU International University of Applied Sciences. Our analysis suggests that **using Syntea reduced their study time substantially--by about 27% on average--** in the third month after the release of Syntea. Taken together, the magnitude of the effect and the scalability of the approach implicate generative AI as a key lever to significantly improve and accelerate learning by personalisation.

1 / (1 - 23%) = 137%

Students studied 37% more efficiently with the help of an AI compared to people who did not use AI. 

Our results suggest that using Syntea (in this case represented by the exam training feature) has helped students to gain an additional uplift in study progress of 46 percent-points relative to the control group. Translated into study duration ratios, this corresponds to a reduction from 81% relative to the control group to 59%, i.e. by about 22 percent-points, or equivalently by 27% (see Figure 3 for a visualisation of this result). While there might be other explanations for the data presented above, the precise temporal alignment of the effect supports this hypothesis.

# Notes

The group that used AI was 45% faster at completing the curriculum compared to the group that did not use AI.
