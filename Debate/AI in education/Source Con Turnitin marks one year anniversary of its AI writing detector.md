# Summary
Of the over 200 million papers reviewed,* Turnitin data shows:  
- Over 22 million (approximately 11 percent of over 200 million) have at least 20 percent AI writing present*  
- Over six million (approximately three percent of over 200 million) have at least 80 percent AI writing present*

[[Source Con AI Detectors Falsely Accuse Students of Cheating—With Big Consequences]] says that around 1% of essays are flagged as being written by AI as false positives and 3% were flagged as being part AI part human

If assuming 200 million papers and 2 million are false positives, 4 million papers have at least 80 percent AI writing present and are not false positives. 

If 6 million would be falsely flagged for being part AI part human, then deducting that, 8% of all papers had at least 20 percent AI writing present, or 16 million.
