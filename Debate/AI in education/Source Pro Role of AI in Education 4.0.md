# Summary

In the United Kingdom, 42% of primary and secondary teachers used generative AI to aid with their schoolwork in November 2023, a significant increase from 17% in April 2023.

New developments in AI can provide an opportunity to redefine the nature and quality of work in education roles. Research by the World Economic Forum, produced in collaboration with Accenture, finds that **40% of all time spent on tasks could potentially be impacted by large language models** (LLMs). This applies to teaching as well: while some teaching tasks could potentially be automated by these new technologies, other tasks stand to be augmented or enhanced by LLMs (see Table 1).

Tasks with the most potential to be automated or replaced by LLMs are those that tend to be routine or repetitive. In the education sector, up to 20% of work time on clerical activities and administrative tasks, such as assessing attendance, enrolment and other forms of data analysis, could be automated. Tasks most likely to benefit from the augmentation potential of LLMs tend to emphasize analytical and problem-solving capacities. These tasks make up 8%-20% of work time spent on tasks in the education sector and include lesson planning and evaluating student performance

## Kabakoo
Kabakoo employs an AI-enabled virtual mentor to provide 24/7 support to learners. This virtual mentor offers guidance, resources and advice whenever needed, supplementing human mentorship. The AI mentor also provides personalized feedback on learners’ assignments. After submitting their selfie video on a specific module, learners receive a personalized response via WhatsApp. Recognizing the linguistic diversity in Mali, Kabakoo is working on developing an AI-powered model to provide training in Bambara, the most spoken language in the country. In applying AI to address language barriers, Kabakoo promotes personalization, accessibility and inclusivity. The use of gamified virtual tokens (Kabakooins) and cloud-based resources contributes to a dynamic and robust learning environment

The success of the programme is evidenced by a randomized control trial that resulted in a 23% increase in growth mindset among learners in a pilot conducted at Kabakoo. Kabakoo learners also report seeing a 44% increase in income six months after completing the programme.

## Letrus
Letrus focuses on personalized learning through AI, offering immediate feedback to students, real-time data for educators and monitoring tools for school managers. Teachers receive tailored recommendations for content and methodologies, which can be seamlessly integrated into the curriculum to nurture and enhance specific skills. This iterative process ensures a dynamic and responsive approach to literacy development, aligning closely with the evolving needs of each student as well as the entire class. School managers can monitor progress and gain immediate insights into improvement areas as well as emerging learning gaps that may benefit from targeted intervention through teacher-training initiatives or strategic adjustments to the curriculum.

In 2022 the programme achieved notable success in the public schools of Espirito Santo. Within five months of programme implementation, participating students achieved the second position in the national writing exams, a remarkable improvement compared to the eighth position attained by the control group. Letrus was subsequently designated as the official literacy development programme for high school students in the state. Espírito Santo emerged as the top-performing state in the writing component of the National Exam, exhibiting a performance delta five times the national average from 2021 to 2022

Students participated in 32% more writing activities, and discussed with teachers regarding writing 35% more. 

## Ceibal
AI lessons are utilized to help students understand the inner workings of machine learning models and gain insights into the use of data, as well as the potential biases present. The programme employs various evaluation tools, including learning tests, surveys and class observations. The programme’s aim is to foster the competencies of solving computational problems, data and information analysis, algorithms and procedures, as well as social transformation, acknowledging the integration of computers into our everyday lives.

Ceibal participates in the Bebras Competition, an international exam on computational thinking. A recent sample of Bebras exam results showed that students who participated in the programme significantly outperformed those who did not, with some differences observed in favour of girls. This community-driven initiative led to the integration of computational thinking competence into Uruguay’s 2023 educational reforms

## UAE AI Tutor Project
The AI tutor tailors lessons to the individual needs and learning styles of each student, ensuring that they receive the right level of challenge and support. It continually assesses student progress, identifying areas of improvement and providing targeted feedback and additional resources to help students overcome their challenges. The tutor can also provide support in multiple languages, ensuring that students from diverse linguistic backgrounds also have access to quality education. By automating certain teaching tasks and providing valuable insights into student progress, the UAE AI Tutor project aims to alleviate teacher workload, enabling them to focus on more strategic and interactive aspects of the learning experience. The platform also generates detailed reports for educators and parents, enabling them to monitor and support student progress effectively. Further, the AI tutor breaks up linear and time-consuming methods of feedback to provide real-time analytics to all stakeholders, including at the ministerial level, enabling more adaptive strategy development.

The project already showed improvements during the piloting stage in average grades and positive impact on students’ academic performance. It demonstrated a 10% increase in learning outcomes.
