# Summary
The best AI writing detectors are highly accurate, but they’re not foolproof. _Businessweek_ tested two of the leading services—GPTZero and Copyleaks—on a random sample of 500 college application essays submitted to Texas A&M University in the summer of 2022, shortly before the release of ChatGPT, effectively guaranteeing they weren’t AI-generated. The essays were obtained through a public records request, meaning they weren’t part of the datasets on which AI tools are trained. _Businessweek_ found the services falsely flagged 1% to 2% of the essays as likely written by AI, in some cases claiming to have near 100% certainty.

3 essays flagged as AI, 9 essays flagged as part AI, part human, 488 essays flagged as human, total 100 essays analyzed
