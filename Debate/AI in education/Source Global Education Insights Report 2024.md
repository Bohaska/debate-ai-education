# Summary
41% of educators across all six regions believe AI has had a mostly positive impact on educational outcomes, compared to 19% who believe its impact has been mostly negative.

32% of educators are already using GenAI, which increases to 63% when including those who have either used or are expecting to use it in the next year. 80% have either already used GenAI or are expecting to use it at some point in the future.

48% of educators say they would mostly or completely trust the accuracy of information students get from GenAI chatbots and 48% say they only slightly trust it or not trust it at all, showing a dramatic split in sentiment.

The top two benefits of AI that educators believe will have a positive impact on education were: reducing time spent by them on administrative tasks (65%) and the ability to personalize learning experiences of each student (63%).

However, educators also identified areas of concern around the use of AI, including negative effects on academic integrity (32%), critical thinking (31%), memory retention (30%), and social skills and relationships (29%). Among US Higher Ed educators, the group that perceived AI most negatively, the areas in which the perceived negative impact was most strong were academic integrity (68%), critical thinking (62%) and "social skills/relationship" (58%).
